<p class="dropcap">“How long is it before Christmas,
Miss Edith?” inquired Mammy
Rose, bending forward to peer into the
oven where two mammoth fruit cakes
in the process of baking were sending
out a delicious, savory odor.</p>

<p>“Just five days more, I am sorry to
say. The yellow opera bag is still unfinished,
so are the monogram handkerchiefs;
these nuts must be picked for the
praulines, and Agnes and I have undertaken
to set the children’s doll house
in order before the holidays. Rob and
Jerry say we girls ought to begin to
make our Christmas gifts on the 26th
of December to be ready by next year.”</p>

<p>“Hit ’pears to me, honey, you an’ Miss
Agnes with yo’ needles and paintin’ has
turned out nigh ’nough contraptions fur
a county fair. Sakes alive! Miss Edith!”
exclaimed Mammy Rose, glancing through
the window into the garden, “Look at
dat big barr’l w’at Jeff’s a-bringin’ in!”</p>

<p>The kitchen door opened suddenly and
the good-natured face and woolly head of
the yard man appeared inside for a moment.</p>

<p>“Here’s a heap o’ apples or oranges
w’at somebody’s done sont,” he announced.
“De ’spress man dumped ’em
at de side do’. I ’spect dey’s a present;
he said thar wan’t nothin’ ter pay.”</p>

<p>“O! They must be oranges or grapefruit
for Mother from Florida. Uncle
Alex always remembers us at Christmas
time,” said Edith. “Roll them into the
store room and remove the head of the
barrel!”</p>

<p>“We sho’ air gwine ter hev’ some nice
little puddin’s did Christmas ef folks
does say de orange crap’s a failure,”
declared Mammy Rose, standing with
arms akimbo, her face brightening over
the prospect of good cheer, then, in a
stentorian voice she hailed the young
negro who was disappearing in the direction
of the barn.</p>

<p>“You Jeff! Stop dar! Wa’n’t dar a
box or a package or somethin’ else lef’
here? Dar ought ’er been,” she said,
assuming an air of mingled mystery and
importance. “I was kind o’ ’spectin’ a
’spress package myse’f.”</p>

<p>“You? An express package, Mammy
Rose? From whom?” asked Edith,
pausing in her work to scrutinize the
picturesque and somewhat bent figure
in the plaid gingham apron and bandanna
head-handkerchief.</p>

<p>“From dem lazy niggers up dar in Virginia,
Lizzie and Callie. I’m gittin’
mighty tired o’ deir onreliableness, always
promisin’ an’ promisin’ ter do
things an’ neber doin’ ’em. ’Pears ter
me like a little book learnin’s done
turned ’em plumb fools, but ef dey does
flop dey se’ves ’round wid dey high edycation,
de’s one word in the booktinary
dey ain’t neber foun’ de meanin’ ob;
dey don’t know nothin’ ’tall ’bout gratichude.
Ain’t I done had dat Lizzie and
Callie down here, livin’ off o’ me a whole
winter, neber feelin’ sure fur cartain dat
dey was my nieces, dey being yaller-brown
like m’lasses candy an’ me as
black as der pot hit’s made in? Ain’t I
axed ’em ter come all unbeknownst ’case
dey wrote dey was my sister Car’line’s
orphan chil’un, an’ case dey come from
Petersburg whar I come from when I
was a little gal? Ain’ I sont ’em things
an’ sont ’em things Christmas after
Christmas till I’se clean wo’ out? I
b’lieves in ’ciprocation, I does fur er
fac’!”</p>

<p>For more than thirty years Mammy
Rose had been a faithful employee in the
Radcliffe family, and naturally everything
that affected her happiness was
a matter of household concern. She had
taken up her abode in the old Colonial
residence before any of the children were
born, and, in point of fact, she was as
much a fixture there as were the
drawing-room mirrors or the mahogany
stairway. As an accomplished cook,
Mammy Rose’s reputation had spread far
and wide till she had become the envy
of every troubled housekeeper in the vicinity.
Strange to say, though she could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
prepare a hundred dainty dishes fit “to
set before a king,” she couldn’t for the
life of her have given the exact recipe
for a single one. When asked how she
made her famous Sally-lunn, corn-pudding,
waffles or jelly cake, she would look
very wise and say, “You see, I cooks
by ’sperience; I takes a little ob dis,
an’ a little of dat, an’ ef tain’t ’nough
I takes some mo’.” But, perhaps, in the
care of young children Mammy Rose was
most truly in her element. She loved
them and “spoiled” them as if they were
her own, and often, when tired of wrestling
with the pots and kettles, she would
resort to the nursery for a fresh assignment
of duty. Nothing delighted her
more than to play the role of fairy
godmother to the little folks.</p>

<p>Provoked beyond her habitual good
humor on this December afternoon by
the neglect of her young kinswomen,
Mammy Rose’s tirade was at its height
when Mrs. Radcliffe stepped into the
room to give an order. Upon hearing the
names Lizzie and Callie pronounced in
strident, contemptuous tones, she glanced
significantly at Edith, suspicioning that
the derelict nieces were again at the
bottom of the trouble.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t set my heart upon getting
that box if I were you, Rosa,” said the
mistress, when the matter had been explained.
Judging from past delinquencies
that the girls’ promises were of the
pie crust kind, she wished to soften the
servant’s disappointment.</p>

<p>“Now, see here, Mammy, Lizzie and
Callie may not be totally ungrateful, but
perhaps they just won’t remember to
send you a gift,” suggested Edith, offering
the only consolation that came to
mind.</p>

<p>“Humph! won’t remember!” sniffed
the old darky, with a fine show of
scorn. “What is it de Scripture says
about rememberin’—Thee, O, Jerusalem,
if my right hand be cut off? They can’t
fergit dis time! I done made Jeff write
ter Lizzie and Callie mo’n a month ago
tellin’ ’em ’xactly w’at I’se ’spectin’!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you surely didn’t do that!” cried
Edith, amused as well as shocked at the
old woman’s candor.</p>

<p>“Yes’um, I swar I did!” came the
unwavering reply. “Thar’ ain’t no beatin’
’round de bush ’bout me; ef dey’s got
a spark ob decency or se’f-respec’ dey’ll
do w’at I tole ’em.”</p>

<p>“What did you say you wanted?” asked
Mrs. Radcliffe, whose curiosity had become
thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p>“I tole ’em ter sen’ me a bedquilt an’
I sent ’em a bushel o’ calico scraps ter
he’p it ’long. Then I wanted a big jar of
watermillon-rind pickle, a gallon of
peach preserves, an’ er sack full ob fresh
goose feathers. Last of all I axed fur er
warm gray shawl. Ef dey had ter leabe
off anything, I said let it be dat shawl,
ca’se my ole one’s mighty nigh good
’nough to w’ar to pra’r meetin’s an’
funerals.”</p>

<p>During the days that intervened the
conversation in the kitchen and the
Christmas festivities, Mammy Rose was
constantly on the alert, each morning
awakening with new hope and at night
evincing great disappointment as package
after package arrived for old and
young and nothing came for her. By the
morning of the 24th, she had become
extremely morose and ceased to take further
interest in the holiday preparations.
However, even in that state of mind she
continued to hail every express man, delivery
man, and “A. D. T. boy” who came
in sight, demanding to know whether
they had a package at the ’spress office
for Rose Wilkerson that they were “too
triflin’ ter deliver.”</p>

<p>But, poor old soul, miserable as she
was, she was by no means the only individual
who was dejected over the non-appearance
of the presents from Lizzie
and Callie. Edith and Agnes were inclined
to regard the matter very seriously.
In fact, after luncheon on Christmas
Eve, they called a family council in
the library, desiring that some action be
taken in the case. In spite of pressing
engagements elsewhere, Mr. and Mrs.
Radcliffe, Grandfather and Grandmother,
Rob and Jerry, and Uncle Joe Echols
were present to lend a sympathetic ear
to this vexed domestic problem.</p>

<p>Edith as voluntary counsel for the
faithful stewardess plead her cause feelingly,
eloquently, and with eminent success.
Every member of that august body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
agreed that Mammy Rose must receive
her box before bedtime on Christmas
Eve, preferably by fair means, otherwise,
by foul. If, upon investigation at the
Southern office, there proved to be no
package for her from those Virginia ingrates,
why Old Santy himself must provide
one. A very simple plan was put
into operation. The men formed themselves
into a “ways and means” committee,
authorizing the girls to draw upon
them for the necessary finances. Mrs.
Radcliffe believed that she could purchase
a pretty calico quilt from the
“Ladies’ Aid Society” of her church, and
the pickle and preserves could be procured
from the Woman’s Exchange.
Grandma thought she knew where a soft,
warm shawl might be found and
she put on her bonnet and cloak to
go and select it herself. In the
bustle and stir of the fleeting afternoon,
however, the sack of fresh goosefeathers
loomed up as a staggering proposition.</p>

<p>“Suppose we give her an eiderdown
sofa pillow; she can rip it and take the
feathers out after Christmas if she
wishes to make some other use of them,”
proposed Agnes.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all right. We haven’t time
to go poking around in poultry yards or
to rip Grandma’s feather bed,” chimed
in Rob.</p>

<p>“Buy her a pair of flannel foot-warmers
as a contribution from me,” said Grandpa
Radcliffe. “I am aware how uncomfortable
cold feet are in the winter.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ll have all of that—I was
about to say plunder—up at my office
at five sharp, I’ll undertake to send it out
in a transfer wagon by half-past six,”
said Uncle Joe, thus solving the last
difficulty.</p>

<p>By the time the family had assembled
for the sumptuous Yule feast that evening,
the depression of Mammy Rose’s
mental status manifested itself in
grumpy monosyllables. She was secretly
lamenting the fact that she had
told anybody about her expectations. The
other servants had been whispering and
snickering over her chagrin, or, she
thought they had, while the white people
from the children up seemed fairly bubbling
over with Christmas mirth. Apparently,
every one had some particular
reason for rejoicing except herself. Thus
far, this Christmas had been the most
“disappintin’” one that she could remember.</p>

<p>Half an hour later when the salad
course was being served the cuckoo clock
and the front door bell sounded in unison.
Everyone seated around the table gave
an expectant start. Presently the man
servant staggered in under the weight
of a great wooden box that was directed
to “Rose Wilkerson, Care of Mr. Theodore
Radcliffe, 456 Spruce Street, Memphis,
Tenn.” Mammy Rose bounded in
through the back hall door the moment
her name was pronounced. The thunder
clouds had disappeared from her brow
and her face was wreathed with smiles.
“I know’d it, I know’d it all along!” she
declared. “My, but ain’t it heavy, an’
don’t h’it rattle. It’d be jes like dem
scatter-brained gals ter pack things so
as ter get peach preserves all ober my
bran’-new shawl.”</p>

<p>A friendly audience followed the radiant
old woman to the kitchen amid
stifled laughter and concealed nudging
and many pairs of eyes rested with
affectionate interest upon her while she
nervously assisted Jeff to draw out the
nails. The first thing that met her gaze
was the peach preserves; three whole
jars of it were lifted out in succession.
“Land o’ Goshen!” she exclaimed. “Ain’t
I gwine ter hab a feast? They must o’
thought I was gwine ter set up a eatin-house—an’
a whole gallon o’ watermillon-rind
pickles. Ef dat don’t beat——”</p>

<p>Rob had extracted the gray shawl
from the odd conglomeration in the box,
and he laid it lightly over her shoulders.
“Lor! Dis here gyarment sho’ is warm
an’ must er cost a heap o’ money. All dis
comin’ on top o’ my grumbling, too.
’Pears like wonders don’t neber stop
ceasin’!” Next she drew out the satin
sofa cushion and for a half a minute
she stared at it in blank amazement. For
the first time vague misgivings as to
where the gifts came from began to
arise within her. “My—ee! Dis sho’ is
pretty, an’ somebody had mighty good
taste,” she ventured to say. She handled
it very gingerly, however; according to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
her way of thinking it hardly seemed
intended for her personal use and was
far too perishable to adorn a negro cabin.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess Lizzie and Callie must
hev struck the Louisiana Lott’ry,” she
declared, sighting the pink and white
satin quilt. “Dis here spread cartin’ly
is made after a handsome pattern, but
I’ll be blest ef I knows how dey done it
out o’ dem mixed calico scraps. Jes ter
think o’ dem young niggers puttin’ dey
se’ves to all dis trouble fur de sake ob
Mammy Rose!”</p>

<p>In the midst of her jubilation the electric
bell rang again; rang furiously this
time. A man at the door handed in a
wooden box about two and a half feet
square. It was for Mistress Rose Wilkerson
and came from Petersburg, Virginia.
Every confederate in the room
gasped audibly. Mammy Rose grasped
the end of the table to steady herself.
Mr. and Mrs. Radcliffe exchanged uneasy
glances, Grandma Radcliffe turned
very white and sat down suddenly, and
a sepulchral silence reigned broken only
by the sound of the hatchet in Jerry’s
deft hand. To the darkies assembled in
the background there was something
“spookey” about the square parcel; they
wouldn’t have touched it for worlds.
Edith was the first person to whom the
humorous side of the situation presented
itself. Stepping forward with commendable
presence of mind, she tore away
the brown butcher’s paper that concealed
the contents of the second box. A small
gray plaid shoulder shawl fell out upon
the floor; a card was attached to it
bearing these words: “To Aunt Rose
from her deserving nieces Lizzie and
Callie Goode.”</p>

<p>Simultaneously both women dived into
the melange of queer treasures and
brought forth a little China vase that
was decidedly “niggery” (no other word
could adequately describe it<!--you could emphatically have done better than this one-->), a small jar
of peach marmalade, and a sack of loose
goose feathers. That last article broke
the spell. Further effort at maintaining
the deception was useless—the plot was
out. Mammy Rose, no longer mystified,
but on the verge of hysterics over the
honors done her, essayed to express her
gratitude: “Well, if you all ain’t de beatin’est
white folks an’ ef I ain’t de discomboberatedest
critter dat ever——!”
Choking with emotion, she raised her
brimming eyes to her benefactors to find
herself—alone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Air_and_the_Water">The Air and the Water</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Wm. Denison</span>, <span class="smcap">Fargo, N. D.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“The air and the water contain all
the invisible essences of things,
that from which all plants and minerals
arise, and of which they are, so to speak,
only condensations or precipitations, so
that they become manifest to our crude
senses.” Assuming that the above idea
is the truth, and we fully believe it is,
then the air and the water of this earth
certainly must play a most important
role in the weal or woe of all things
terrestrial, whether animate or inanimate.</p>

<p>Corroborating the above idea, at least
the air part of it, which is true, being
of such paramount importance was advanced
four or five years ago at a meeting
of the National Convention of Chemists,
at Washington, D. C. But they
failed to recognize that the water was
equally as important. However, some
wonderful things were said at that meeting
of chemists, among others, that for a
long time past suggestions had been
thrown out to the effect that the exhaustion
of the soil would inevitably wipe out
the human race; or at least reduce it
greatly in numbers before many hundred
years. But these scientists announced a
new discovery, which put another face
on the problem. They declared that this
country alone was able to support In
comfort 500 million people—a number
equal to nearly one-third the world’s population
at that time. Thanks for this
discovery. The land, while producing
greater amounts of foods, is to become
steadily richer and more fertile. This
great discovery of these chemists at the
national convention, is that it is atmosphere,
and not the soil, mainly, that produces
the crops. Take all the hay or
wheat or corn that is yielded on an acre
of land and burn it, stalks and all. It will
all disappear save about two per cent of
the total weight. This two per cent of ash
represents what the soil has furnished
in the shape of mineral matter. The farmer
of the future must look above for his
nitrogen. Aye, and also look below for
his moisture. With the aid of this new
knowledge the present wheat growing
regions can be multiplied by three. Today
ten average acres planted to wheat
produce 150 bushels of cereal. With
very little trouble and slight cost those
average ten acres can be made to yield
400 bushels. This is simply a question
of increasing the average yield from thirteen
to about forty bushels.</p>

<p>A good many acres of new land in the
Northwest produce forty bushels of
wheat at a crop. They do it because
the land contains the requisite quantities
of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash.
Supply those materials to other
acres in proper amounts and with climatic
conditions not unfavorable their
yield will be as great.</p>

<p>According to these chemists this is
the keynote of the whole business. They
say it is no longer accepted as a fact
that a non-fertile field is useless. On the
contrary, it is known that such a field
merely needs to be supplied with the
proper elements, cheaply obtained, in
order to produce richly. Suppose a farmer
has such a field, and that he has
intelligence enough to take advantage
of the new knowledge. He goes to a
chemist and has a sample of the soil
analyzed. One, perhaps more, of three
things is certainly the matter with it.
It lacks potash, it does not contain sufficient
phosphoric acid or there is an
undue absence of nitrogen. Just for argument’s
sake, suppose that there is
enough potash and phosphoric acid—the
two mineral earth elements essential to
the make-up of plant life, but that nitrogen
is lacking. The chemist, in that
case, tells the farmer that he must put
his field into condition to absorb the
nitrogen from the air. This is extremely
simple, and this is all there is about it.
All the farmer has to do if his soil is
deficient in nitrogen is to plant a legume
(of which there are 6,500 species scattered
over this earth of ours) suitable
to his section of country. The cowpea
is best adapted for the South, and beans
and red clover for the North, or any
other leguminous plants suited to his
locality. These plants have an affinity
for nitrogen, and they drink it from the
atmosphere as a baby takes milk from
a bottle. The most costly and indispensable
of all plant foods is nitrogen. Yet
there is plenty of it at hand, inasmuch
as that substance composes eighty per
cent of the atmosphere. The only trouble
is to get it out of the air and into
the soil, but there is no real difficulty
about that.</p>

<p>Strange, is it not, readers, that the
costliest, most expensive plant food—nitrogen—heretofore,
to every farmer,
is so abundantly supplied by an all-wise
Creator.</p>

<p>We have been advocating through the
press this knowledge for the past twelve
years, which these scientists call new.
But we regret that in their deliberation
they did not give due consideration, in
fact, not any at all, of the equal importance
to the water end of this article.</p>

<p>If the reader will refer to the account
of the creation in the first chapter of
Genesis, seventh verse, he will see that
the Creator’s second day’s work was
dividing the waters of the atmosphere
and the waters of the earth.</p>

<p>This preceded the third day of creation,
when vegetation began, which
shows conclusively that the waters were
equally as important as the air. It is
obvious, then, that this covering of the
earth’s surface with vegetation was for
a wise purpose, that of conserving the
moistures of the earth without which
there can be no successful crops raised.
It is evident that our climate is changing
in this country. Ten years ago a
writer of Chicago, now deceased, gave a
theory for the cause of our changing
climate, which I indorse. “The cutting
down of our virgin forests, which has
been going on at a fearful rate for the
past sixty years, and also the breaking
up and putting under cultivation so large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
an area of prairie land in so short a time,
is the direct cause. The equilibrium between
the moisture of the atmosphere
and the moisture of the earth is maintained
by the virgin forests of a country,
and when the virgin forests are
slaughtered, as they have been in this
country by the lumber kings, that equilibrium
is lost. Then comes drouth, fires,
famines, pestilence and death.”</p>

<p>This theory is borne out in the fact
that there always is so much humidity
in the atmosphere during a protracted
drouth. The histories of the ancient and
modern civilizations also bear out this
theory. There is no doubt but that the
ancient civilizations had immense virgin
forests to begin with, and that as soon as
these virgin forests were consumed, then
the equilibrium between the moisture
of the atmosphere and the moisture of
the earth were destroyed and one after
the other of these great nations have
perished by drouth, famines, fires and
pestilences. I cannot recall to mind
ever having seen a natural spring of
water on a treeless prairie. It is in the
timber we find them, showing conclusively
that the forests of a country make
the great reservoir of its water supply.</p>

<p>To come down to modern civilizations,
a pertinent comment is that made by Mr.
Charles F. Adams on one of the causes
that have led to the downfall of Spain.
It is a fact that this peninsula once supported
a population of about 45,000,000, but
now holds a meager 17,000,000. The main
reason for this is stated by Mr. Adams.
“During the last three years I have spent
much time in Europe, visiting among
other countries Spain, Italy, Germany,
France and England, and whoever wishes
to study the effects of deforesting on a
country and on its people should by all
means visit Spain. Not only has the
country been ruined, but the character
of the people has been changed by the
wholesale destruction of trees, and the
neglect of their renewal. The rivers have
become mountain torrents and a large
portion of the country is a rugged
upland desert. The same process is
to-day going on in Italy. The results
in that country as noticed by me
in visits ten years apart is lamentable.
The ancient forests are being wholly
stripped from the mountains, and while
the rivers are converted into torrents,
the water is not held in the soil. In Germany,
on the other hand, the forestry
laws are admirable. The result upon the
country, climate and rainfall is apparent
to the most careless observer.</p>

<p>“It is certainly timely to urge the United
States that it shall not permit itself to
copy the Spanish example of decay in
this or any other respect.”</p>

<p>The facts stated by Mr. Adams have
been corroborated again and again, to
the effect that the denudation of the
mountain slopes of Spain and the erosion
of its soil have reduced it to a condition
of semi-aridity and lessening its
power to support population, one-third of
which are to-day indulging in bread riots.
Of all the civilized nations, we most
nearly copy the Spanish stupidity in the
waste of our forests. We should certainly
set about showing ourselves to
be wiser than the nation whose decay is
now so evident.</p>

<h3>Part I. St. John’s Church, Ashwood, Tennessee.</h3>

<p class="center">By JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In “The Banner of the Cross,” a Philadelphia
paper, a writer, whose name
is unknown, wrote, in 1842, the first description
of the now famous chapel, St.
John’s Church, on the pike leading from
Columbia, Tenn., to Mt. Pleasant.</p>

<p>“It was my privilege,” says the writer,
“in the month of January, 1834, to listen
to the details of the progress of the
Church in Tennessee from the lips of
Bishop Otey, who had just been consecrated.
I did not think then that in
God’s providence I should ever witness
in person the results of the Bishop’s
labors in the then far-off country. But
yesterday (September 4, 1842), which
was a bright, beautiful Sabbath, I witnessed
a scene gladdening to a church-man’s
heart, and knowing your interest
in all that concerns the Church in the
Southwest, I have thought a sketch of
it might be interesting.</p>

<p>“In this country, upon the road leading
from Columbia to Mt. Pleasant, and about
six miles from the former place, in a
grove of majestic and towering oaks,
may be seen a neat brick church of simple
Gothic architecture; its interior plain
and appropriate and capable of seating
five hundred persons.</p>

<p>“It has been just completed and is the
result of the joint liberality of Bishop
Polk and three of his brothers, who,
with a spirit worthy of commendation
and imitation, have devoted a portion
of the wealth with which God has
blessed them to his service.</p>

<p>“Without aid from abroad, these gentlemen
have erected and paid for this
edifice and presented it, together with
a plot of about six acres of land, to the
diocese. The lot has been selected from
an eligible portion of the bishop’s plantation,
within a few hundred yards of
whose mansion the church stands. It
has been erected for the convenience of
the few families in the neighborhood
who, with a large number of negroes on
their plantations, will make quite a congregation.
For the latter class the
bishop has been in the habit, for a long
time, of holding regular services in his
own house. They will now have an opportunity
of worshiping in a temple which
they may almost call their own.”</p>

<p>After referring to the services in the
church on the day of its consecration,
the writer continues:</p>

<p>“There is yet one thing which I must
not forget to notice. I have said that on
the adjoining plantations there are negroes
for whose spiritual good this
church was in part erected. By the time
the white congregation was seated in
the body of the church, the door, the
vestibule, the gallery and staircase were
crowded with blacks. Even the vestry
room was filled with them, an old man
sitting within the doorway, almost at the
very feet of the clergy. A happier group
I have seldom seen. Some of them had
prayer books in their hands, but, for
their general benefit in singing, the
psalms were given out in the old-fashioned
way—two lines at a time—and, I
am sure, during the singing the loudest
psalms of praise came from the sable
groups.</p>

<p>“When the whites had commenced, a
cordial invitation from the bishop was
given to the blacks to come forward. At
the same time he explained in a few
words what was required of them in
worthily partaking of that sacrament.</p>

<p>“Then quite a great number came, with
much reverence and devotion, to that
feast precious alike to bond and free.
Ah! could some of our friends have witnessed
that scene, how it would have
silenced a suspicion that a slaveholder
values not the soul of his slave. Thus
does the enlarged benevolence of these
men embrace a class hitherto too much
neglected, a class which, in our good
city of brotherly love, are suffered to
grovel in ignorance, degradation and sin:</p>

<p>“Here will they learn to worship God
in spirit and in truth; here be taught to
pray with the heart and with the understanding
also; and here, when death has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
arrested their course upon earth, will
they find a resting place under the tall
old oaks in their own churchyard; for
the lot upon which the church is built
has, for some time, been set apart for
the purpose.”</p>

<p>As intimated above, the church was
built by the then bishop, after Gen.
Leonidas Polk and his brothers, upon
their own estate, for the accommodation
of the communicants around them and
their slaves. The description above presents
a feature of slavery which was common
throughout the South, and shows
how zealously the master looked after
the spiritual welfare of his slaves.</p>

<p>The Polk family—not the President,
James K. Polk—who lived in Columbia,
six miles away, and was a relative of the
Ashwood Polks, but the Polks at Ashwood—lived
in true baronial style. The
most distinguished of that family was
Bishop Leonidas Polk, who, while bishop,
was the moving spirit in the erection of
the chapel, copying after the rural chapels
of England. Leonidas Polk was educated
at West Point for a soldier, and
graduated in 1827, but so strong was the
other side of his character that he resigned
his commission in the army and
entered the ministry. This was a sore
disappointment to his father, the old
Revolutionary soldier, Col. Wm. Polk,
causing him to write to his son that the
step was the spoiling of a good soldier
for a poor preacher.</p>

<p>But the old gentleman, who himself
had joined Washington’s army at the
age of eighteen years and had fought
all through the Revolutionary War, being
thrice wounded and gaining the title
of Colonel and the reputation of being
one of the ablest soldiers of his day,
was greatly mistaken in this choice of
his soldier-preacher son. Not only did
Leonidas Polk become one of the great
pioneer preachers of his day, but, as
Dr. Wm. M. Polk says in his biography<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
of him: “It might have touched the feelings
of the veteran if he could have
known that Leonidas would one day
buckle on the sword—that he would lead
more men in the field than his father
had ever seen arrayed in battle, and that
he would die at last a soldier’s death
in the field of honor, fighting for what
he deemed to be the cause of right and
liberty.”</p>

<p>Speaking of Col. Wm. Polk, the same
historian tells this amusing incident of
the old soldier:</p>

<p>“When Lafayette returned to America
in 1824 and made his memorable tour
through the States, Colonel Polk was one
of the commissioners appointed to do the
honors of the State of North Carolina to
his old comrades in arms.</p>

<p>“An eye-witness has left an amusing
account of some incidents of the reception
of Lafayette on his passage
through North Carolina. Col. William
Polk has been requested by Governor
Burton to provide a cavalry escort for
the illustrious visitor, and a troop of
excellently drilled and handsomely uniformed
volunteers was formed from the
Militia of Mecklenburg and Cabarrus
escort, under command of General
Daniel, and met Lafayette near the Virginia
line. There was much hand-shaking
and speech-making.”</p>

<p>“But,” as the narrator writes, “Lafayette
spoke but little English and understood
less. He had retained a few
phrases, which he would utter, generally
in an effective manner, but sometimes
ludicrously mal a propos.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, my dear friend! Great country!
Happy man! Ah, I remember!”
were nearly his whole vocabulary. He
was received at the borders of each State
by appointed commissioners, and when
he had been escorted through it he was
safely delivered to the commissioners of
the next commonwealth. At Halifax the
cortege was met by General Daniel, who
had stationed a company of soldiers by
the roadside, flanked by the ladies, who
were assembled to do honor to the guest
of the State. It had been arranged that
the ladies were to wave their handkerchiefs
as soon as Lafayette came into
sight, and when General Daniel exclaimed
“Welcome, Lafayette!” the whole company
was to repeat the welcome after
him. Unluckily, the ladies, misunderstanding
the programme, waited too long,
and were reminded of their duty by a
stentorian command of, “Flirt, ladies,
flirt! flirt, I say!” from the general, who
walked down the line to meet the Marquis.
Equally misunderstanding their
part, the soldiers, instead of shouting,
“Welcome, Lafayette,” in unison at the
close of the general’s address, repeated
the sentence, one by one, and in varying
tones.</p>

<p>“Now a deep voice would exclaim:
‘Welcome, Lafayette!’ then perhaps the
next man in a shrill tenor would squeak:
‘Welcome, Lafayette!’ and so on down
the line. Daniel, frantic at the burlesque
of his order, vainly attempted to correct
it, but as he unfortunately stammered
when he was excited, his ‘Say it
all to-to-together!’ could not overtake the
running fire of ‘Welcome, Lafayette!’
which continued all along the line.
‘Great country! Great country!’ replied
Lafayette, turning to Colonel Polk, who
was vainly trying not to smile. Observing
and recognizing an old acquaintance,
Lafayette greeted him with great effusion:
‘Ah, my friend; so glad to see you once
more! Have you prospered and had
good fortune these years?”</p>

<p>“‘Yes, General, yes; but I have had the
great misfortune to lose my wife since
I saw you.’</p>

<p>“Catching only the ‘Yes, General,’ and
the word ‘wife,’ Lafayette supposed he
was informing him of his marriage, and
patting him affectionately upon the
shoulder, he exclaimed: ‘Happy man!
Happy man!’ nor could be made to understand
that his observation was not a
happy one.</p>

<p>“After replying to the address of welcome,
which had been delivered by Colonel
Polk from the steps of the Capitol,
Lafayette, with all the dramatic action of
a Frenchman, turned to Polk and before
the old soldier knew what he was about,
threw his arms about his neck and attempted
to kiss him on the cheek. Colonel
Polk straightened himself up to his
full height of six feet four, and instinctively
threw his head back to escape the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
caress; but Lafayette, who was a dapper
little fellow, tiptoed and hung on to the
grim giant, while a shout of laughter
burst from the spectators and was with
some difficulty turned into a cheer.</p>

<p>“Of Col. William Polk’s influence in the
State of Tennessee, Governor Swain, of
North Carolina, has said: ‘He was the
contemporary and personal friend and
associate of Andrew Jackson, not less
heroic in war and quite as sagacious
and more successful in private life.”</p>

<p>“It is known that Colonel Polk greatly
advanced the interests and enhanced the
wealth of the hero of New Orleans by
information furnished him from his field
notes as a surveyor, and in directing
Jackson in his selections of valuable
tracts of land in the State of Tennessee;
that to Samuel Polk, the father of the
President, he gave the agency of renting
the most fertile section of that State;
and selling his (William Polk’s) immense
and valuable estate in lands in
that, as first President of the Bank of
North Carolina, he made Jacob Johnson,
the father of President Andrew Johnson,
its first porter, so that of the three native
North Carolinians who entered the
White House through the gates of Tennessee
all are alike indebted for benefactions
and for promotions to a more
favorable position in life to the same individual,
William Polk—a man whose insight
into character rarely admitted of
the selection and never of the retention
of an unworthy agent.”</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war, Leonidas
Polk was appointed Major General by
Jefferson Davis and became one of the
great generals of the Confederacy. He
was killed by a cannon ball, on Pine
Mountain, near Marietta, Ga., June 14,
1864.</p>

<p>Continuing the subject of the slave-owners’
interest in the spiritual welfare
of his slaves, Miss Beauchamp, who was
governess in Bishop Polk’s family, tells
this amusing story:</p>

<p>“The Bishop, who would at times be
away for weeks on visitations through
his diocese, always brought on his return
joy and pleasure to the household.
He would amuse us for days with a recital
of his adventures in the border regions
of Louisiana and with the people
he would meet there. On one occasion,
having been up Red River, where an
Episcopal clergyman was seldom seen,
he was called in to baptize a sturdy, four-year-old
youngster, who defiantly resisted
sacrament unless his black Fidus Achates,
Jim, would receive it at the same
time. ‘Well,’ said the Bishop, ‘bring in
Jim and I will make a Christian of him,
too.’ Accordingly, Jim, being instructed
by his mistress, was brought into the
parlor; the pair went through the ceremony
with perfect propriety and were
dismissed to their play. Meanwhile, the
friends and neighbors who had called to
assist at the baptism and pay their respects
to the Bishop, sat in solemn state,
awaiting the announcement of dinner.
Smallpox had been lurking in the country.
Every one was excited on the subject
of vaccination, and discussions as
to whether it had taken on this or that
subject had been the order of the day for
more than a week. Suddenly the circle
was astounded by the reappearance of
Jim, who exclaimed, almost breathless
with excitement: ‘Mistes! mistes! you
must have Marse Tom baptized over
ag’in; it never tuck that ar time. He’s
out yonder cussin’ the steers wusser’n
ever, and says he ain’t gwinter stop for
nobody.’ The ice melted at once, and
the stiffness of the circle vanished as
the Bishop turned to his hostess and
said: ‘A commentary on the doctrine
of baptismal regeneration, my dear
madam.’</p>

<p>“Every Sunday afternoon all the negroes
on the plantation came up to the house
and were taught by Mrs. Polk, her daughters
and myself in different classes. Singing
entered largely into the exercises,
many of the negroes having a taste for
music, and some of them excellent voices.
The ceremonies of marriage and baptism
were always performed by the Bishop
himself and the names chosen by the negroes
were sometimes very amusing.
Many of them could not read, and they
showed their appreciation of Greek mythology
and Shakespeare by the number
of Minervas and Ophelias among them.
One Sunday twenty-five little negro infants
were taken into the Bishop’s arms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
and christened. Though the scene was
a very impressive and interesting one,
yet some of the names were so droll to
my ears that I could scarcely preserve a
becoming gravity. One was named
‘Crystal Palace,’ another, ‘Vanity Fair,’
etc. But when a little creature, black as
Erebus and squalling with its mouth extending
to enormous size, was taken into
the Bishop’s arms to be named ‘Prince
Albert’ it was impossible for me to resist
longer, and a heavy fit of coughing,
gotten up for the occasion, saved me
from a reproving look from the Bishop.’”</p>

</figure>

<p>One of the most beautiful and touching
scenes is quoted further from the
same book, and related by the Bishop’s
wife, on page 176.</p>

<p>After describing the visitation of cholera
in the winter of 1849-50, and the
Bishop’s almost fatal illness from it, together
with almost all his family and the
death of nearly a hundred of the servants
of himself and friends, Mrs. Polk
relates this touching incident:</p>

<p>“As soon as the Bishop was able—indeed,
at the risk of a relapse—he was
at the bedside of the sick and the dying.
The last case of cholera occurred on the
7th of June, when a very fine servant,
named Wright, by trade a blacksmith,
was attacked. His master had been
reading and praying with him. Wright
raised his head and said: ‘Master, lift
me up.’ ‘I am afraid to, Wright,’ the
Bishop said—‘the doctors say it might
be fatal.’ ‘I am dying now, master; lift
me up.’ The Bishop raised him, when
Wright suddenly threw his arms around
his master’s neck and exclaimed: ‘Now,
master, I can die in peace; I do love
you so I have often wanted to hug you,
and now let me die resting here on your
heart and you praying for me!’ His
wish was complied with and soon he was
at rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>St. John’s Church received its most sacred
and consecrated fame during the
war. When Hood’s army invaded Tennessee
after the fight around Atlanta, in
November, 1864, the route of the army
lay along this pike in the march to Nashville.
The army had been marching over
the poor lands of the barrens, the hills
of Georgia and the barrens of the Highland
Run, and when it entered Middle
Tennessee, in the garden spot of which
sat this little church, Gen. Patrick
R. Cleburne, who had won great
fame as a dashing fighter, raised his hat
to the restful beauty and quietness of
St. John’s and remarked: “If I am killed
in the coming battle, I would like to be
buried yonder.” In a few days occurred
the bloody battle of Franklin, in which
not only Cleburne, but Generals Gist,
Strahl, Granbury and Adams—five of the
greatest field officers of Hood’s army,
were killed, and all except Generals
Adams and Gist, were buried in the beautiful
cemetery at St. John’s. Years afterward,
one by one, their remains were
exhumed and carried, with fitting honors,
to their former homes, where monuments
had been erected to their memories. General
Adams was killed on the breastworks,
his horse falling half over, and he
himself over in the enemy’s lines supported
and soothed by one of the officers
who mourned the mortal wound, saying
that he was too brave a man to die. Cleburne
fell leading his men up to the
breastworks.</p>

<p>The communion silver for St. John’s
was given by Mrs. Sarah H. Polk, the
widow of the old Revolutionary soldier,
and the mother of Gen. Leonidas Polk.
It was beautiful and massive. The war
left St. John’s desolate, the Federal army
burned the beautiful and imposing mansion
of the fighting bishop, the communicants
were scattered and for nearly half a
century the picturesque chapel has, with
occasional services in it, alone stood silent
sentinel over its great dead a monument
of an heroic age.</p>

<p>The account of how the communion
silver was saved during the war is a
story told by one of the ladies of the
Polk family, and so generally interesting
that it is related here, as it illustrates
so perfectly the peculiar superstitious
nature of the negro:</p>

<p>One of the most faithful negroes belonging
to Col. Geo. W. Polk was a negro
named Wiley, who had been in the family
as a trusty and faithful servant for so
many years that Colonel Polk thought
he could trust his life in Wiley’s hands.
Another negro was old John, a very
old negro, who was gardener, and too
old to do much more than keep up the
flower garden and the walks of the estate.
Word was brought to Colonel
Polk that some Federals stationed
in Columbia, six miles away, intended to
make a midnight raid on St. John’s and
secure the silver service at the church.
Perhaps it was Wiley himself who
brought the information, and that the
raid, or rather the theft, would occur
that night. It did not take Colonel Polk
long to act. Soon after dark, taking Wiley
and a small express, he went to the old
church and secured the silver. Silently
he and the negro went out in the dark
carrying the silver in a large cedar box
and taking off the top of one of the old
square box-tombs, he hid it there and
placed the top slab back in its place.</p>

<p>Trusting Wiley implicitly, he did not
believe the silver would ever be found.</p>

<p>Several days passed, and Colonel Polk
felt that all was secure. But one morning
as he walked early in the garden he saw
old John, the gardener, looking at him
furtively and in a peculiar way. Wiley
was also around, and the old negro
showed plainly that he wished to say
something to his master that he did
not wish Wiley to hear. Knowing the
negro nature as he did—that they never
came out openly and said what they
thought—and that the furtive glances
which old John gave him now and then
meant more than words, the Colonel
waited until Wiley had left, and purposely
entered into conversation with
the old negro. He did not want to flush
his game, as he would have done by a
direct question, so he patiently waited
until the old negro should speak in his
own way, for he knew that the old negro
has something important to tell him in
his own negro way.</p>

<p>“Marster,” said the old man at last,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
“I had sich a quare dream las’ night, I
thort I’d tell you, and maybe you could
’terprit it for de ole man. It’s hung onto
me all day an’ pestered me so I can’t
wuck, an’ I can’t do nothin’ till I tells
you. I feels sho’ it means old John is
gwineter go soon, fur I seed two angels
as plain as I ever seed anybody, but I
can’t jes zackly understan’ it all, an’ I
thort maybe ef I’d tell you, you mout
he’p me.”</p>

<p>“Go on, John,” said the Colonel; “I
shall be glad to help you interpret the
dream.”</p>

<p>“Wall, Marse George, I dreamed I wuz
down at the ole church a wanderin’
among the tombs, out in the ole part,
among the trees. An’ den I kinder fell
into a trance, an’ den I heard a voice
say: ‘John, git up an’ come wid me.’ I
riz an’ looked, an’ I see a pale light shinin’
from de church winder, an’ bimeby
I seed, two angels come out uv de church.
One wuz er white angel an’ one wuz er
black angel, an’ dey carried de corpse of
er leetle chile in dey arms. Dey come out
de church an’ put de coffin in er waggin
an’ den dey move off solem. I foller de
sperits, an’ dey carried de corpse of
dat leetle chile to er ole tomb an’ tuck
offen de top an dey put de leetle dead
chile in de ole tomb an’ den dey vanished.
It seem lak a long time went by—mebbe
two nights—an’ den I seed, way in de
night, ’twix’ midnight an’ day, other
sperits ride inter de ole church yard—soldier
sperits, mounted on steeds—an’
dey rid up to de tomb an’ broke it open
an’ tuck de corpse of de leetle chile an’
went away. Now, Marse George, dat’s
pesterin’ me mighty. Whut dem soldier
sperits wanter pester de body uv dat
leetle chile fur?”</p>

<p>The Colonel saw at once the application
of the dream, and that it was the
negro way of warning him without letting
Wiley know that the warning had ever
been given. He reassured the old darky,
who walked off to his work satisfied.
That night Colonel Polk went alone to the
old tomb and took out the silver, burying
it in his garden. About midnight, Wiley
led the Federals to the tomb, only to find
the silver gone. But Wiley never came
home again. Knowing that his secret
was out, he ran off with the soldiers.</p>

<p>For many years, as remarked above,
St. John’s held the remains of Generals
Cleburne, Strahl and Granbury, three of
the five generals who fell around the
breastworks of Franklin. But one by
one, as the years went by, the remains
of these brave men were removed and
carried to their native States—Cleburne
to Arkansas, Granbury to Texas—and
finally, after nearly forty years of rest
among the trees and under the beautiful
bluegrass of St. John’s the gallant young
soldier, Strahl, was taken to his old home
in West Tennessee. Above them all, the
people of their native soil have erected
suitable monuments.</p>

<p>Only a few years ago were the ashes
of Strahl removed. A brave, handsome
young fellow he had been, daring as a
soldier and true and self-poised, one of
the recognized great soldiers of Hood’s
ill-fated army. He led his men up to
the side of the Federal entrenchments
and down in the trenches. With those who
had not been killed or wounded, he
stood, and “keep firing” was the word he
passed up and down the thin line, hugging
one side of the breastwork while
their enemies held the other, not six
feet away. Mr. Cunningham, editor of
The Confederate Veteran, who stood near
the general, tells it: “The trench was
filled with the dead and the dying. Standing
with one foot on the bodies of my comrades
and the other on the bank, I rested
my rifle upon the top of the breastwork
and kept firing at the enemy on the other
side. The line had been so thinned that
only a solitary fellow soldier stood near
me, and now he was shot and fell heavily
against me and tumbled over in the mass
of dead men. This left me alone, and I
asked General Strahl, who had stood for
a long while in the trenches and passed
up loaded guns to men above: ‘What
shall I do, General?’ ‘Keep firing,’
came back, and almost with the word
the general himself was shot, and while
being carried to the rear was struck
again and instantly killed.”</p>

<p>This was the brave young soldier who
had lain for nearly forty years in his
grave, and whom we were going to disinter
and send back his ashes to his old
home. It was a raw March day, some
three years ago, when the committee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
from his State came for his remains, and
as I stood by the grave and saw the
muddy soil upturned beneath which,
many years ago, had been laid the form
of a handsome, brave and gallant man,
cut down in the hey-day of his life and
hope, I could but wonder at the changes
the forty years had made. These men,
who gave their lives for the cause, believing
as truly as did their sires of old,
that they were fighting for the right of
self-government, could they awake to-day
would wonder at the turn in the tide of
affairs. A nation, the greatest in the
world—the leader of thought and action,
the champion of the defenseless and the
power that stands for the real advancement
of humanity; a people so thoroughly
reunited that many of the very men who
fought by the side of this one, who died,
had fought since in the old uniform, under
the old flag against the foes of their
country. And, strangest of all, not one
of the two things that this brave life died
for would be accepted by his sons if given
them to-day—the institution of slavery
and the right of a State to secede.</p>

<p>These, if offered to the South to-day,
would be unanimously rejected. Alas,
what is our boasted wisdom but the wisdom
of babes? And our bravery, what
more than that of the unthinking school-boy
who fights for a ring of marbles
which he afterward throws at the birds?</p>

<p>Here once was a man—free, blessed,
brave and handsome.—“Seeking the bubble
reputation, even at the cannon’s
mouth.”</p>

<p>Now, behold, we have gone down to
where his body had been laid away, and,
instead of a form, there is a dark line
of mold where the coffin had been, part
of the sole of a cavalry boot, a few bones
and a skull.</p>

<p>Stooping, one of his old soldiers bent
reverently to lift the skull of his general,
and place it in the handsome casket intended
for its final resting place. But
it clung to the earth, and on looking we
see that a beautiful rose bush that had
been growing all the years at his head
had sent its roots down, completely filling
the skull and drawing nourishment
from the mind that had once led conquering
lines into battle.</p>

<p>’Tis sentiment only that counts at

that from the brain of the brave should
come the perfume of the rose? Or, as

<p>The American nation, being young and
foolish—a fighter, a doer, a seeker of
dollars in the strenuous race called living—does
not, in this century cherish
as it will centuries hence, such a historical
pile as the beautiful old chapel.
For a sum, right now there are those who
pass it dally who would tear it down
to build a stolid stable for their asses.
There are others who pass it without
a thought, save, perhaps, that ’twere a
pity so much good brick should go to
waste. There are others who would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
like to remodel it, turn it into a dwelling,
with Queen Anne shingles and a portico
in front. In England, such piles
as these are their inspiration and their
pride—sermons in stones, history in
walls, battles in bricks and mortar. It
is these that cement the Englishman’s
love for his country, its institutions, its
laws. It is these which make him love
to call it home. We are in the reckless,
wild oat stage of money daring, of wealth
producing, of gaudiness and strutting
display. There is no place among us
now for the poet and the scholar, the
musician, the dreamer, the preacher. But
the time is fast coming when all this will
be changed—when to be unread is to be
unbred—to be rich is to be rotten. In
that day this quaint, epoch-making, history-shingled
chapel, this pile of soul-nobleness,
this monument to right on the
battlefield of might, will outshine all the
gilded domes which vulgar wealth has
erected as a monument to vanity in the
plains of plenty.</p>

the oldest and most natural gait of the
horse, and that the old pacer was the
thoroughbred of antiquity, the companion
of kings, the warhorse of mighty
warriors, the animal that carried on his
back the daughters of Pharaoh and the
princesses of Babylon. And yet, when
this gait began to outcrop among the
trotters, making that grand type of the
racehorse known as “trotting-bred pacers,”
hundreds of people have been wondering
“Where did it come from?” Let
us see from whence it came:</p>

<p>There is no real difference in form between
the trotter and the pacer. The
theory of “structural incongruity” will
do to talk about, but as a matter of fact
there is no such thing, and a pacer paces
and a trotter trots, not from his shape,
but his head—his instinct.</p>

<p>When the curtain went up on antiquity,
horses were pacing. They paced because
it was the natural gait of the animal, the
trot of later years being the artificial
gait. We know that the horses of the ancients
were small—pacing ponies—and
the running horse was not developed until
centuries after.</p>

<p>The oldest civilizations of which we
have any record of the horse are the
Egyptian and the Babylonian. On the
tombs the horse was always carved pacing.
The frieze of the Parthenon was the
work of the great artist Phidias. His
horses were pacers. Five hundred years
before the Christian era the great sculptors
of Greece and Rome put some of their
greatest work into statues of horses—all
pacers. Relics of some of the very
earliest Greek friezes are still preserved
in the British Museum and show the
horses to be pacing. At the beginning of
the Christian era the Romans had conquered
the Britons and the horses
they found there, or carried there, they
called “ambulatores”—amblers—and during
the five hundred years that Rome
ruled the island these horses were the
favorites for the saddle and light driving.
In 1215 A.D. the barons wrenched from
King John the famous Magna Charta, the
great seal of which is a knight in armor,
mounted on a pacing horse. In a previous
chapter we have told how Sir Walter
Scott describes them and how for
centuries the pacing horse—the ambler—the
jennet, was the favorite, if not the
only saddle horse of the knights and ladies
and the nobility.</p>

<p>Could such a horse have been a scrub?
For many years there has lived in England
a wealthy American who is an
artist and a fond lover of horses—Mr.
Walter Winans. I am indebted to Mr.
Winans for many valuable discoveries
about the pacer, the first of them being
his letter and illustrations showing the
original drawings from the Egyptian
tombs, these carvings being copied by
Mr. Winans while studying ancient Egyptian
sculpture.</p>

<p>Some years ago, Mr. Walter Winans,
of Brighton, England, sent me sketches
of bas-reliefs taken from Egyptian tombs.
While never having had before the
pleasure of seeing a cut of the bas-reliefs
sent to the writer by Mr. Winans,
I have known of their existence and have
repeatedly called attention to the fact
that the past history of the pacer demonstrated
beyond a doubt that he was a horse
of the noblest blood, the war-horse of ancient
battles, the companion of ancient
kings and princes. The fact that he
has been able to do what he has done
is convincing proof of a past greatness
somewhere in his breeding—a scrub would
have died at the wire long ago. If “society”
is looking for something that is
blue-blooded, with a hoariness that no
other blue-blooded can boast of; that is
eminently respectable to a degree bordering
on classical mythiness; that is
more ancient than the pyramids and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
more respectable in lineage than the longest
pedigree of Norman knight, I respectfully
refer it to the pacer. My only regret
in the matter is that the recognition,
by “society,” of distinguished lineage,
illustrious achievements and present
worth cannot be a subject of mutual acknowledgment
and congratulation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">Brighton, Eng., Jan. 23.</p>

<p>Dear Trotwood: I have brought the
pacer to more than four thousand years
ago. Prof. J. E. Marey, Professor of the
College of France, has just published a
book called “Le Movement,” dealing with
the correct drawings of men and animals
in motion. He gives two engravings, of
which I enclose pen copies, one of them
from an Assyrian bas relief, the original
of which is in London, England, British
Museum; the other is a copy of an ancient
Egyptian Bas-relief at Medynet-Abou, in
Egypt. They both represent horses pacing.
Prof. Marey says (freely translated
from the French). “Examples of a pacing
gait are here accurately represented.
It is of all gaits the easiest to observe,
and therefore to draw, on account of the
symmetry of movement.... Trotting,
which is so often represented in modern
works, seems rarely to figure in that
of the ancients.”</p>

<p>I noticed lately in one of your contemporaries,
which goes in for “society,” a
suggestion that pacing races should not
be held on days that trotting is indulged
in, so as not to offend road riders (a long
list of which it gives), who dislike to
see a pacer. It is a good thing that these
road riders did not live four thousand
years ago, or they would have been
shocked to see all the rulers and great
men of Assyria and Egypt driving pacers.
The ancient Romans called trotters “tormentores,”
on account of the way they
shook them up, riding without stirrups.</p>

<p>Referring to the pictures again, the
reason the figures holding the symbols of
authority (the half-circles) and the
groom at the horses’ heads being so small,
is because that in ancient Egyptian conventional
art figures were not drawn in
their proper proportions, but large or
small, according to the importance of
the person represented.</p>

<p>The Assyrian pacer looks as if he must
be the champion stallion of the period.</p>

<p class="center">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">WALTER WINANS.</p>

</div>

<p>I agree fully with Mr. Winans concerning
the form of the Assyrian pacer above.
Fewer can show up today with a finer
turned muzzle, face and neck, or show
more strength, beauty and symmetry in
form than the one in the outline above.
Concerning the cobwebbed suggestion of
the “society” paper about pacers being
barred the track on trotting days, I beg
to assure the author of the above letter
that the brilliant idea died a-borning.
There is plenty of brains and progressive
spirit yet left among the managers
of American trotting associations, and
these gentlemen prefer rather to increase
than to diminish the interest in the light
harness horse. The pacer and the trotter
are indissolubly linked together—in
interest, destiny and blood. They have,
too, much of the same breeding, too
many kindred ties. Joined, as they are,
by so many common ancestors, united
as they are by so many great horses,
no number of society asses can now pull
them asunder.</p>

<p>In discussing this subject later, Mr.
Winans wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is one difference between a
trotter and a pacer which I can show
in sculpture, which has never been
shown before by any artists, as painters
cannot show it. I mean the upright,
locomotive-like progression of a trotter
and the side stride of the pacer. In a picture
the difference of the gaits can only
be shown by the position of the legs. In
sculpture we can show how a trotter
puts down his feet on each side of the
imaginary line drawn on the ground
straight under him, in the direction he
is going, as the following illustration
will show.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_136" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“But this is not true with the pacer.
On the contrary, he puts his feet right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
on the line, as the following diagram
will show:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_137a" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_137a.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“I can better explain myself by the
following: If I model a horse standing
still, and then cut off the two left side
legs and model fresh ones in the act of
being lifted up, so as to represent one
position of the pace, I would have to
push or bend the body of the horse over
to the left till a plumb line from the
center of his body would hang down to
touch a line drawn on the ground from
his two feet touching the ground, but if
I wanted to make a trotter from the
same model of a standing horse, I could
make the fresh legs without having to
bend over the body to either side.</p>

<p>“It is curious that the bronze statuettes
of the pacer would not stand firm
unless I bent the body over, which shows
that nature knows just how to place
animals so that the center of gravity
should be right. Horses in the instantaneous
photograph positions balance on
their legs, but if I model in the conventional
position of the run, I have to put
a prop under the bronze horse’s belly,
like most artists do.”</p>

</div>

<p>The subject of the proper balancing of
harness horses is generally recognized
as one of the most important in the business,
and it is highly probable that more
otherwise good drivers fail there, in the
proper management of their horses, than
in any other thing. Properly balanced,
the battle is half over in the training
of a naturally speedy horse.</p>

<p>The idea suggested in the letter above,
if true, as it undoubtedly appears to be,
naturally suggests that a very different
system should be adopted in the proper
balancing of pacers and trotters. It is
impossible, of course, to tell how much
the individuality of each horse would assert
itself in attaining the ends sought
in this direction, but so far as the mere
matter of avoirdupois is concerned, it
will be seen that on general principles
the pacer, on account of moving a rear
and fore foot at the same time, can
come nearer having both shoes on those
feet equal, than the trotter, where the
aim should be to equalize the alternate
feet.</p>

<p>It is very plain the balancing required
for one will not do for the other, and
horsemen who think they know all about
a pacer from successful handling of trotters
will find out their error. For my
own part, I believe it requires less skill
to balance a pacer than a trotter, for the
reason that, because of his simple action
he can come nearer wearing the same
weight on all feet than any other horse.
As proof of this I have only to refer my
readers to the fact that nearly all the
very fast pacers carry but little
weight, equally distributed, and require
little protection.</p>

<p>This correspondent has placed us under
additional obligations by enclosing
us a pen drawing, executed by himself,
on a trip into Northern Russia, which we
reproduce below, and which he calls “a
typical pacer from Finland, Russia, used
by the peasants for farm work, fourteen
hands high.” As Finland is in the northern
part of Russia, beyond the latitude
where the native horses of any country
grow much higher than fourteen hands,
the height is not to be wondered at; and
as the peasants of Finland are of the
poorer classes the natural inference is
that the pacer is a natural product of
northern Europe, and, no doubt, may be
found in their native state in many, if
not all, of these countries, such as Siberia,
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, The
Netherlands, and even North Germany.</p>

<p>“There is no native trotter in England,”
writes Mr. Winans. “That is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
say, there is no breed of horse that can
beat the very low standard of 3:30. The
so-called Norfolk trotter is too slow
and is never used for racing purposes in
England. To supply this dearth of trotters,
they had to import from Russia and
the United States. Now, a fast trotter
from the States costs more than the class
of men who go in for trotting in England
cared to pay, so pacers, which could go in
three minutes or a little better, were
got over instead, and as the difference
between trotting and pacing is not understood
in England, they got to be called
trotters, and raced as trotters. As a
proof of their not understanding pacers,
a big dealer in horses saw a friend of the
writer’s driving an American pacer and
said, ‘There, that is what I call trotting
in good form!’ The other country the
English import trotters from is Russia.
Now, in Russia there are two sorts of
trotters, the ordinary Orloff carriage
horse, which can go close to three minutes,
if a good one, and the racing Orloff
trotter, which can go up to about
2:20. Now, the latter are too expensive,
so the ordinary Orloff carriage horses
were imported. It was soon found that
they were not fast enough to have any
chance even against very poor American
pacers, so the American pacer became
the trotter of England. This refers to
the high class, or what corresponds to
the free-for-all trots. There is another
lower-down class of trotting which is by
far the most common in England. The
races, or generally matches, take place
on the road, and the police (it is forbidden
to race on the roads) often put
a stop to the races, and they have to
be arranged discreetly. The matches are
announced on some such lines: ‘Mr. So-and-So’s
pony, Tommy, matched for $25
to trot two miles on the So-and-So road
against Mr. So-and-So’s pony, Billy.’</p>

<p>“By the way, till quite lately a trotter
in England was always a pony; they did
not talk of trotting horses, but trotting
ponies. For this class of racing the
ponies are some 12½ to 14½ hands high
and driven to very heavy, old-fashioned
sulkies. The ponies used are not English-bred,
but what are called in England
‘Russian’ ponies. They are not really
Russian, but come from Finland. These
‘Finnish’ ponies are a distinct breed.
They are on an average 14½ hands high
or under, strongly built, with thick,
short necks, very good feet and legs,
bushy tails, and very hard mouths. They
are generally all shades of sorrel, dun
or chestnut, many with donkey marks
down the back, and light-colored manes
and tails, and they are for the most part
natural pacers. These are the horses
that are used in St. Petersburg for the
public droshkies which ply for hire and
are very cheap. Some can go close to
three minutes, with an occasional one
close to 2:40, and are imported wholesale
into England for light tradesmen’s use.
In Russia they are also used by the peasants
for farm work.</p>

<p>“The Orloff trotter is quite free from
pacing. The many I have driven have
never showed the least sign of pacing,
with one single exception; this horse
was not one of the racing Orloffs, but
one of an ordinary carriage pair. I think
he had a cross of the ‘Fin’ pony, by his
shape. He used to pace when jogging,
but I never tried to get any speed at the
pace out of him.</p>

<p>“The little ‘Fin’ ponies are very fast
occasionally for their size. As an instance,
we had a black pair of Orloffs
when I was last in St. Petersburg, which
used to pass everything on the road. It
is the custom there, when you have fast
horses, to brush with anything you meet.
One day a victoria, drawn by two little
dun-colored ‘Fin’ ponies, with some ladies
in it, came along. We turned out
to pass them and they ran right away
from us, which no big pair had been able
to do all the summer. This particular
pair trotted, but as I said before, most
of them are pacers, and these are what
race in the minor races in England as
‘trotting ponies.’”</p>

<p>The conclusion is evident—the pace
is the natural and probably the first fast
gait of the horse.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The horse is conceded to be the
most intelligent of animals, the best
friend to man, and until recently the
most universally used and most necessary;
yet the same animal is also the
most universally abused. Men hitch the
poor animals in harness that is sometimes
too small, or too large, as the case
may be, and in consequence he rebels and
refuses to pull a load when by doing so
he suffers torments by chafing, or from
choking, if the collar be too small. This
is all that is necessary to stigmatize the
poor brute as being balky, and unless
some humane person happens to run
across the animal it will be spoiled, and
no one will take it as a gift. Now, as
a matter of fact, the horse that absolutely
refuses to be treated thus is the horse
that has the right material in him and the
one that will give you most service, providing
you treat him right. The horse
I own was such an animal and was
given up as a “runaway” and “kicker.”
Yet he is now so gentle that he will
absolutely refuse to run away on any
pretense whatever. Upon hearing that
a fine looking but “mean” horse was
for sale, I took occasion to visit the
owner and learn something of the “outlaw.”
After seeing the animal, even after
I had learned that he had been in runaways
and had broken up at least four
buggies, I bought him for $150, but not
until I had made a phrenological examination
and found that the horse was particularly
well supplied, as I thought, with
good horse sense. I could see that his
disposition was “keyed” up pretty high
and that trait combined with a broad
forehead and a good eye, suited me, and
was what I always select in an animal.
The price was as nothing, when we consider
that he was a Woodnut by Nutwood,
and that his sire sold for $22,000,
and his grandsire for, I think, considerably
more.</p>

<p>I only drove the animal a few times before
he was as gentle as a lamb and has
never committed one unkind act while I
was with him. He now performs twenty
tricks and is trained to hunt, and enjoys
it. I shoot over his head and he waits
for me to get the game. He will stop
when he sees a rabbit and expects me
to shoot it. If you want your animals
to be kind to you you must first treat
them kindly. After driving this “runaway
horse” for a few months my wife
and I drove across the mountains on a
hunting trip. On going down a steep
grade the buggy upset and we were both
thrown out, but the wild horse absolutely
refused to run away. He would have
been as kind to his former owner if he
had been treated properly. You can tyrannize
over some people, while others
will fight back, and it is just so with
animals.</p>

<p>A horse never forgets anything, and if
he is badly scared in a certain place, he
will show the same fear if brought back
to that place a year afterwards. A horse
will develop the same disposition as the
man who drives him, and if the man is
nervous and fretful, by continually jerking
the lines and striking the horse with
a whip, he instills this irritability into the
poor horse, and sooner or later the animal
starts up too soon, and, expecting
to be whipped, runs off at the top of his
speed, perhaps killing somebody. Of
course, the poor horse is to blame for
this (?). Sometimes he is hitched so
close to the wagon that he cannot trot
without striking his hocks against the
vehicle and, thinking he is being abused,
he will run away. If the traces are too
tight he will suffer from sore shoulder
or sore neck.</p>

<p>Never allow a blacksmith to spring a
shoe in a place by pressing down and
nailing. Have him take the shoe off and
straighten it on the anvil. Do not allow
him to cut the frog away as it furnishes
nourishment and moisture to the hoof.
Don’t check your horse too high unless
you wish him to be knee sprung. In
shoeing horses some people are of the
same opinion as is John Chinaman when
buying boots. They want to get all the
material they can for their money and
in shoeing a horse too heavy you not only
ruin his gait, but cause him to get tired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
sooner than he otherwise would. In driving,
control your animal by speaking
to him. By following this method and
being kind, not allowing yourself to lose
your temper, you will be surprised at
the control you will have over your horse
in a short time. If the animal wishes
to run away there is no man strong
enough to hold him. You cannot stop
a runaway by sawing on the bit, but if
you will not lose presence of mind and
not get excited, you can stop any horse
and cure him of trying to run by the
following method: Grasp the lines tightly
and pull as tight as you can. Let one
line slip through your fingers (not losing
it entirely), and pull hard with the other,
which will bring the horse’s head around
to the side. If you hold his head in that
position you will throw him down as the
legs will become mixed by thus drawing
the head to the side. If you leave his
head free once more he will stagger but
not fall and will have great respect for
the driver who can thus mix him up.
This is something that every one should
know, as no horse can run unless he can
have his head in front of him. To control
him it is necessary to jerk the head
quickly, and the driver must keep the
horse from turning around, thus upsetting
the rig. Should your horse get
frightened at any object, do not whip
him; scold him and drive him carefully
up to the object and he will eventually
become so gentle and observing that he
will recognize objects and not get frightened
at them.</p>

<p>Should he get away from you do not
get into a passion and beat the animal
as soon as you get him again, for he
will always remember it and you might
be miles away from home and should
he get loose, you will have to walk, as
he will not care for another beating and
will leave you “alone in your glory.” On
the other hand, if you are kind to him
you can go among a band of wild horses,
and yours will leave them for you.</p>

<p>Horses know more than they are given
credit for and have been known to carry
their master home when the owner was
intoxicated and unable to walk after getting
there. A great many horses are
spoiled by the driver forcing them to do
something when the horse does not know
what is wanted of him. Show him what
you wish him to do and he will do it.
Never fool your horse and always praise
and reward him for doing good. Horsemen
will tell you that it spoils a horse
to teach him tricks. Does it spoil a child
to educate him? My buggy horse that
performed twenty tricks was thought to
be a spoiled horse but at the State fair I
could not get a race for him with trotters
and had to enter him with pacers that
were going in :17, :19 and :20. He was
never driven better than :26, but did not
make a break, and won handily in straight
heats, and the last was :24. In trying to
beat him they ran him into a fence, and
on the back stretch locked wheels, making
him drag the other under the wire
in :24. That did not excite him, because
I had educated him and he came
back the next heat (fourth) in :24 in
a jog. By educating your horse, you
give him courage, make him brave,
and he becomes almost human, just like
Lou Dillon when, in a mighty drive she
becomes part and parcel of the greatest
educator of animals who ever existed—Millard
Sanders. The old familiar quotation,
“Full many a flower is born to
blush unseen, and waste its sweetness
on the desert air,” is exemplified time
and again, when we see trainers driving
animals with a world of speed, not knowing
how to shoe, handle or drive them.
Would education spoil these men? Training,
gaiting and educating a horse is a
mathematical problem, and the man who
can teach a little each day and who
understands that by increasing the action
in front means something to the
hind hoofs, and by slowing up the action
behind means something to the front
hoofs just as it does to multiply and subtract,
is the man who takes the purse
at the race meeting even if he does not
make a hit in his workouts. When you
wish to train to perform tricks, start in
with the easiest one first and begin in
the following way:</p>

<p>The first and easiest trick to teach a
horse is to say “no.” Stand on the left
side and with a tack prick him gently
on the withers. He will shake his head.
Ask him a question, at the same instant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
you prick him, and after awhile he will
get so used to the inflection of your
voice that he will shake his head every
time you ask, without the use of the
tack. To teach him to say “yes” prick
him on the breast. Be gentle, so he will
not get in the habit of snapping at you.
For instance, ask him if he likes politics
and he will shake his head “No.” Ask
him if he reads Trotwood’s Monthly, and
he will nod his head “Yes.” Next, teach
him to lie down. Some teach this trick
by the aid of ropes. The easiest way
is to take the horse out of the stall, or,
better, after a drive, just after unhitching,
while he is sweating, lead him to
the corral and say “Lie down, sir.” He
will obey, because he wants to roll. After
he gets up give him some sugar and pet
him. After doing this several times
he learns what is wanted of him and
finds that by obeying he gets his sugar.
Next, you wish him to kneel. This is
easy, as he must always kneel to lie
down. By holding the rope, you can allow
him only to kneel after which you
give him sugar and pet him.</p>

<p>To teach him to sit up it is first necessary
to make him lie down. Then say,
“Get up, sir.” By holding the rope, allow
him to get up on the front feet only.
Next you wish him to open a box. Get
one with hinges and have the lid extend
a little over the box. Allow him to
eat out of it several times, being sure to
close the lid frequently while he is eating.
He will see you throw the lid back
and in a short time will do so himself,
that he may eat the grain. After this be
sure to pet him. In a short time you
can send him from a distance to the box
and he will open the lid. To teach him
to kiss you is the easiest of all. If he
likes candy, as all pets do, place a piece
in your mouth, and he will reach for it.
Say, “Kiss me, sir,” and he will attempt
to get it. He will become accustomed to
the command, after a few times and
will obey the order without the candy.
Next you wish him to stand on a barrel.
Lead him to a box, about five or six
inches high, being sure to have it solid
so it will not turn. After getting him
as close to it as possible, raise one hoof
and place it on the box, then raise the
other and place it by the first, after
which give him the usual reward. As he
gets used to this trick increase the height
of the box until you have it as high as
you wish and he will climb up to get the
sugar. Teach him to shake hands by
picking up his hoof and, at the same time,
giving the command, “Shake hands, sir.”
To teach a horse to tell his age or the
time of day, or to multiply, subtract or
add numbers is the hardest of all and
requires a great amount of maneuvering
on the part of the trainer. Get him impatient
and he will paw the ground with
his hoofs. Pat him every time and he
soon learns what you want. The hard
part is to make him stop at the right
number. Of course there is a key to
this and an easy method may be used.
I stand close to my horse and nudge him
with my elbow when I want him to stop.
For instance, I ask him to multiply
7 × 2, and he paws 14 times. To have
him stop I nudge him just after he
paws the thirteenth time, and he stops
on the fourteenth. Train him to stop,
to turn corners, and to turn around in
this way: When driving go the same
way a number of times, always turning
to go home in the same place and being
careful to turn slowly. Say, “Whoa,”
and then, “Turn around, sir.” After a
little coaxing with the rein he will do
this. In a little while he will know what
is required of him every time you ask him
to turn. Get him used to your gun by
driving him with an open bridle and, for
the first few times, shooting back from
the buggy. By proper handling he will,
after a time, stop when you level your
gun to shoot or, as my horse does, when
he sees anything to shoot at. Teach
your horse to play tag, by giving some
person his sugar and having him run
from the horse. The animal will learn to
put his ears back, show his teeth and run
for the sugar. This should only be taught
horses that are perfectly gentle, as it
makes them cross. When they find people
are afraid of them they always enjoy
frightening them. Many horses are considered
of no value because their owner
does not know how they should be shod.
I shall be pleased to answer any communications
from people who wish to know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
how to shoe horses, how to avoid interfering,
forging, or any of the bad habits
horses may have. All can be rectified
if people only know how. Remember
you can only teach a horse through kindness.
As soon as you lose patience he
will be spoiled.</p>

<p>In driving an animal, if you treat it
kindly and do not lash it with the whip
when there is no occasion for doing so,
it will become attached to you and will
cool down in a moment of danger or excitement,
as it feels that you are its
friend and going to protect it; whereas, if
you were in the habit of abusing it you
may get into a “tight place” and the
horse will get excited and perhaps kill
you. This is something that people should
understand, and how much more satisfactory
it is to have your animals watch for
your home-coming and have them run to
greet you than to have them afraid and
shrink and expect the lash every time
you move. Teach your animals to be
courageous, and then whatever they do
they will go through on their courage
and not by the whip. My animal was
very fast and I hired a trainer to train
him for the track. I gave him instruction
not to whip the horse, and being
headstrong thought he knew it all, so
one day he struck him with the whip and
was immediately kicked out of the cart.
The horse ran for about fifty yards and
stopped. I informed the trainer that he
received his just deserts and he never
drove him again. In this instance the
horse knew more than the man, and I
have seen many such instances. It is
not right that we abuse animals, and we
should not be permitted to do so. They
are willing to obey us and will always do
so if we give them a chance and I am
delighted when I see a horse that will
have the courage to resist ill treatment.
Some people check their horses up to the
skies and never put the check down when
they tie them, but leave the poor animals
tied to a post for hours with their neck
stretched so that they are in constant pain.
It would be a good law that would cause
such men to suffer the same punishment.</p>

<p>It is a very wrong thing to feed a horse
too much hay. It only distends the stomach,
and gives the animal an ungainly
appearance. Feed him regularly, and
four quarts of oats is a good feed for a
buggy horse.</p>

<p>When purchasing a horse, stand directly
in front of the animal and look at
front hoofs. If they toe-in, buy; but if
they toe-out, do not accept as a gift, as
every time he picks his hoofs up, if he
is going fast, he will strike his shin or
knee, whereas, if he toes in, he will
pick them up from his knees and never
interfere and you will not be under the
necessity of placing boots on every time
you wish to speed him. They should toe
out behind and in that case they spread
and pass their front hoofs when going
fast and will not “forge” or strike their
quarters. It is a very common thing for
a horse to trot along and by forging you
can hear them a block away. The click,
click is caused by the hind feet striking
the front ones, and is very annoying,
and at the same time is very bad for the
horse. You can remedy this by shoeing
in front with all the weight in the toe,
causing him to pick up the hoof quicker
and thus getting it out of the way of the
hind shoe when it comes along. If he
interferes behind, shoe with weight on
the outside to spread the hoofs. A horse
should be shod every four or five weeks,
as the hoof grows and the shoe interferes
with its expansion.</p>

<h3>OLD WASH’S LITTLE PREACHER.</h3>

</div>

<p>The other day I was whistling that
coon song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All coons look alike to me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The old man was poisoning potato
bugs on our second crop of Irish potatoes.
It was getting along “t’wards de
shank of de ebenin’,” as I had heard him
so often express it, and I have noticed
about that time that the old man is always
hunting for some excuse to stop
working. “Dar am jes’ two sho’ nuff
fools in dis wurl,” I have heard him say—“one
am de man dat wucks all de time
an de yudder am de ’oman dat don’t
wuck at all.”</p>

<p>I was not surprised, then, to see the
old man set down his can of Paris green
and water and give vent to a prolonged
laugh. I have learned that the way to
catch the old man is to get him when he
is “fit and ready”—the same as a horse
when he is expected to break the record—and
I might carry it further and
say you can’t always tell when he is
ready. But there are certain signs you
can go by.</p>

<p>And so the old man has signs, too—that
he is ready to go a heat in an old
time yarn—and one is when the sun
gets low and the bugs high—when a
watermelon is waiting in the spring
trough and the sheep on the hill begin
to come out from the shaded woods for
their evening meal in the meadow—now
cooling with the condensing shadows of
a setting sun.</p>

<p>The sign he gives is a furtive glance
around and a big, chuckling laugh.</p>

<p>I had cut around the melon with my
pocket-knife, and broken it open on a
big rock, which left the jagged, juicy
heart bulging out in a tempting lump.
But I divided as equally as I could, under
the circumstances, and as we sat in the
shade of the elm by the big spring I
shoved him his half and said:</p>

<p>“Now that’s for what you were laughing
at just now—out with it.”</p>

<p>“I doan’ blame white folks fur sayin’
all coons look alike, fur I tried it onct
and I thou’t I knowed my own kid—thou’t
ef it cum to de scratch I cu’d do
lak a hoss an’ tell ’im by hees smell,
ennyway. But when I wus put to de test
I foun’ dey not only all look alike, but
smell alike, too—an’ dar’s whar I cum
mighty nigh gittin’ into de wuss scrape
I eber got into.”</p>

<p>“Way back in slabery time, when a
young p’ar ob niggers ’ud marry, de rule
wus dey was to lib wid de gal’s muther
ontwel de fust chile was bohn. Ole
marster useter la’f an’ wink an’ tell me
it wus a trick ob de white folks to mek
’em hurry up wid de fus’ chile! Jinerally
we didn’t need no hurryin’ for ole
Daddy Stork is mighty kind to young
folks, ’spesh’ly niggers, which wus p’uffectly
nat’ul, you know—rangin’ all de
way in his visertachuns frum a few
weeks arter de suremony to es menny
months—fur no nigger dat had enny
manhood an’ independence wanted to be
pendin’ on his wife’s mammy enny longer
den he cu’d h’ope it! Den arter de chile
wus bohn de marster ’ud gib a log-rollin’
an’ a house-buildin’—jinerally on a
Sad’dy arter de crop wus laid by—an’
all de niggers frum de joinin’ farms ’ud
cum ober, fetch dey wives an’ babies,
an’ whilst de men cut logs an’ put up
de cabin, de wimmen and gals ’ud quilt
de young p’ar a quilt or two an’ cook a
big dinner ob gumbo soup and green
cohn an’ bakin an’ greens. An’ if de
baby dat de young fo’ks had was a boy
de rule was dat Marster had to fling in
a good big lam’, es er kind ob a free
gratis prize fur ’em gittin’ a boy, an’
den Lord, boss, de barbycue an’ de stew
we did hab! In dem days enny man in
Tennessee cu’d ’still de fruit ob his own
orchard and not pay no rivernew, an’
Marster had a nigger named Pete Gallerway
dat cu’d beat de wurl’ makin’ apple-brandy.
Ebery fawl he’d ’still Marster
twenty gallons an’ it ’ud stay in de
cellar twell de naixt fawl, an’ Lord, boss,
by dat time it wus dat kind o’ stuff dat
es you drunk it in dis wurl’ it seem ter

<p>“I tell you, boss, dey kin preach all
dey please agin good licker an’ de famblys
it busts up, but I’ve knowed menny
a man to git a drink jes in time ter keep
outen a divorcement. I don’t see how
sum men cu’d lib wid de wives dey got
ef dey cud’nt tak a drink an’ furgit dey
mizz’ry now an’ den! Wal, in erbout
three moons it was my time to hab a
house-buildin’ an’ I was mighty proud ob
de job. Dinah was kinder dissociated
kase she’d sat her h’art on de fus’ baby
bein’ yaller. Er ’oman, ob course, ain’t
got no reason fur enny thing—dey jes’
goes by instinct, I reckin—an’ de onlies’
reason she had for spectin’ an’ wantin’
a yaller baby was dat she was allers
mighty fond ob sorrel hosses an’ she
natur’ly hoped her fust child ’ud be a
sorrel. It cum black, of course—jes’ lak
me, an’ arter I opened his mouth an’
seed he hed one tooth already cum an’
ernudder comin’ an’ wus reddy fur eatin’
de fus’ day, I knowed he wus Bre’r Washingtun
up ter the thu’d an’ fo’th jinerashun.
But Dinah she tuck it mighty hard
an’ lowed she’d nurver git over he’s not
bein’ a sorrel wid black p’ints!</p>

<p>“I say he was black, but did yo urver
see a right young nigger? A buzzard,
you kno’, is hatched white an’ turns black,
an’ so er nigger is bohn red an’ turns
black. It’s funny but it’s so. A simon-p’wore
nigger when bohn is red with a
leetle bunch of woolly h’ar on his head,
an’ five holes in his face, de two leetle
ones in de center bein’ whar his nose
gwineter be. Dey ain’t no mistakin’ his
mouth, fur dat’s de bigges’ part of his
vizerbles, an’ in jineral lang’widge you
mout say it curls up on de north an’ is
bounded by hes h’ar, an’ curls down on
de south an’ is bounded by his belly-ban’.
He’s red, ’ceptin’ de skin of his head,
which is sorter yaller, but on the thu’d
day he gin ter turn black jes’ above de
eyes, and in a few weeks he’s all black
’ceptin’ de bottom of his hands an’ feet,
his wottles an’ hock fethers, de tip ob
his stomach an’ de spot whar he sets
on all day.</p>

<p>“Wal, arter de cabin was put up an’
de sun had set, de big stew wus sarved
wid apple brandy an’ den, Lord, de fun
sho’ started! Course I c’u’dn’t be in it
much—de dancin’ an’ juberlashun under
de trees—case I was de keeper ob de
lams, it bein’ my house-raisin’ an’ my
fus-bohn. Now de keeper ob de lams
is dis: de wimmin folks allers bring dey
babies along ter de dance an’ de house-raisin’
an’ when de house is up an’ de
floor laid an’ night cums an’ de games
begins, de babies is all suckled an’ laid
out, ebry one on his own sheepskin, on
de flo’ of de new house fur ter go to
sleep, an’ de daddy ob de new-bohn kid
is called de keeper ob de lams an’ must
set dar an’ watch ’em an’ nuss ’em whilst
de yudders eat an’ play. It’s hard, but
it’s de onwritten law, an’ de objec’ am
to give de new daddy a lesson in pashents
an’ nussin’ an’ keerin’ fur
chilluns.</p>

<p>“Wal, dey was forty on ’em, mighty
nigh de same age, wid a fair sprinklin’ of
sorrels an’ browns, whilst sum look lak
dey mouten be made outen new saddles
an’ jinger cakes. It went agin me mightily
to be pestered wid all er dem new
colts wid dey projeckin’ ways, but I had
a big bottle of apple brandy an’ tuck a
little consolashun frum it now an’ den
myse’f, an’ eb’ry time a kid ’ud wake
up, I’d jes gin ’im a stiff drink ob apple
brandy an’ stick de big toe ob de kid
jes’ above him in hes mouth ter suck on
twell he dosed off. Dey was three long
rows on ’em. I’ll sw’ar, boss, ef onct I
didn’t hab ’em all konnected dat away
lak links in a sausage. Dat an’ de brandy
focht ’em eb’ry time an’ I was jes’ chucklin’
ter myse’f at whut a fine nuss I
was, an’ dat I c’u’d soon be able to go out
an’ hug de gals, too, when dey all commence
to hab de jim-jams in dey sleep—seein’
snakes an’ things an’ howlin’ an’
wigglin’, an’ frum de way some on ’em’s
eyes bulged out dey must er had ellerfants
an’ rinocerasses arter ’em, too.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Wal, suh, I broke fur de stable an’ got
a quart bottle ob stuff we gin de mules
fur de colic—asserfedity an’ h’artshorn,
ladernum an’ tu’pentine, all mixed—an’
den I got de vinerger funnel to git it
down, an’ I drenched eb’ry one on ’em
wild dat mule medercine, stuck eb’ry one’s
toe in de naixt one’s month an’ put ’em
ter sleep ergin.</p>

<p>“Sum on ’em didn’t wake up fur a
week, but dat ain’t de tale I’m tellin’
now.</p>

<p>“I tuck ernuver drink outen de bottle
an’ den I happen ter see one ob de lam’s
dat struck my eye. He was de preacher’s
kid, whose daddy, a yaller feller,
ole mistis had l’arned ’im to read an’
write an’ he tuck to preachin’, and his
lam’ wus a bright sorrel wid flax mane
an’ tail, an’ as he was erbout de size
ob my little coon I thou’t I’d play a joke
on de wimmin folks, bein’ es how Dinah
was sot on habin’ a yaller kid. So I ups
an’ changes de clothes an’ puts de yaller
preacher’s lam’ on our sheepskin an’
ourn on de yuther’s pallet. Wal, suh,
de mo’ I thort of it de funnier it seemed,
an’ den I laffed twell I nearly wake ’em
up again an’ tuck ernuver drink an’
went in ter swap ’em all off. I’d pick
out two erbout de same size an’ sex an’
changed dey clothes an’ bed, an’ when
I got through dere wa’nt nary one on’ em
dat u’d know hisse’f from de naixt one,
an’ es dey all smelt erlike I didn’t see
how dey mammies was eber gwine ter
git ’em straight ergin. Course I ’spected
a lot ob fun when de games broke up
an’ I tuck ernuver drink an’ fix fur ter
see it. But hit seems de niggers played
on twell one o’clock an’ forgot all erbout
time ontwell one ob de patteroles—de
mounted poleece dot kept niggers from
prowlin’ at night in dem days—rid up
wid a hickory whip an’ tole ’em it wus
time fur to go to bed. Dis skeered ’em
so dey all lit out an’ eb’ry ’oman jes’
bundled up her baby an’ left, an’ not
one ob ’em knowed de difference. Es
dey all libbed from one ter ten miles
aroun’ on de farms, thinks I, dar’ll be
lots ob fun in de mawnin’! Dinah tuck
ernuver look at hern befo’ she went to
sleep, an’ den I heurd her whoop: ‘Glory,’
she said, ‘my chile is done turned
yaller—glory—glory!’ She heard of it bein’
done onct befo’ an’ b’leeved it. Wal, I
seed she had her h’art sot on it so bad
I ’lowed I’d let it go at dat, ’specially es
dey nurver had been a preacher in de
family, but all er mine hed tuck to hoss
racin’ an’ Dinah was so happy over it
she c’u’dn’t sleep.</p>

<p>“I sed dar ’u’d be a time in de mawnin’,
but bless you’ soul, honey, it started befo’
day. Lights was seen flashin’ eb’rywhere
an’ niggers was runnin roun’ wailin’ an’
weepin’ an’ wonderin’. De black uns
had yaller babies an’ yaller ’uns had
black ’uns, de upper crust had scrub
babies an’ de leetle black cohn fiel’ scrubs
wus in de highes’ nigger socshul swim—wid
de house gals an’ maids an’ qualerty
niggers. Wuss en all, de chilluns
jes’ slept rat on an’ didn’t seem to keer
whar dey wus an’ who dey b’longed to.
I tell you, boss, ef you eber gits bothered
’bout yo’ chap not goin’ to sleep, jes’ gin
’im a good dose ob hoss medercine!</p>

<p>“It ’u’d been all right, an’ jes’ a joke,
ef dey hadn’t stirred up ole Voodoo Jake,
de witch doctor. He ’lowed de babies
was all right but dey had been voodooed
an’ de culler changed, an’ he’d hafter rub
’em all wid de ile ob a black cat killed
in de full moon on de grabe ob a man
dat hab been hung fur murder, an’ dey’d
be all right. A nigger jes’ nachu’lly
b’leeves all dis, ’specially all dem dat
had de yaller babies an’ not one on ’em
’ud gin ’em up.</p>

<p>“An’ dat’s hu’cum I got a yaller offspring
in my family ter-day, I am sorry
ter say. But arter awhile it got sorter
mernoternous, an’ I thort I’d lak ter git
my own black baby back, an’ I tole ole
Marster whut I done, an’ sum of de niggers
raised sech a stir dat de white folks
hilt a meetin’ an’ did git sum on ’em
back ag’in, but dey’s jes’ about ha’f of
’em now in dat community dat don’t
kno’ who dey daddies is. But dat’s
nachul, you kno’. But Dinah hed got
stuck on de yaller baby, an’ de preacher’s
wife on de black one, an’ tho’ I
kicked about it I c’u’dn’t do nuffin’. I
tole eb’rybody how I dun it fur a joke,
but dey all sed I wus sech a liar dey
wouldn’t b’leeve me. Ole Marster laff,
an’ say he hated to swap off a good black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
colt for a yaller one, but ef it suited
de wimmin folks it suited him, an’ so
dar I was.</p>

<p>“Wal, dey soon found I was right, for
when de boys growed up a leetle, an’
big ’nuff fur dey pedergree to sho’ up,
whut you’ reckin my black un dun ’fore
he ten yeahs ole? De preacher tuck
’im ter campmeetin’ an’ he got up a mule
race on de outside an’ broke up his
daddy’s campmeetin’ one day by ridin’
ole Marster’s gray mule cl’ar over a
bunch of mourners an’ spite of punishment
an’ pra’ars arter dat, he tuck to
ole Marster’s stable an’ dey ain’t nurver
got him out of it yit.</p>

<p>“An’ dat yaller dog I got, he warn’t
long showin’ de mettle er his pasture an’
de proof er his pedergree,” and the old
man sighed and looked troubled.</p>

<p>“How?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Boss,” he said sadly, “befo’ he was
ten yeahs ole he stole eb’ry yaller legged
chicken in de na’borhood.”</p>

<h3>A CHRISTMAS GOOSE HUNT.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The graceful and beautiful wild goose
that nests in the Canadian and
Northern lakes and marshes, makes his
winter home in Tennessee. I think it is
the winter wheat that attracts him, as
he passes over us, en route to Florida,
for wheat is sown in October in Tennessee
and by Christmas it is as green
as the marsh grasses he left behind in
Canada. I do not blame the wild goose
for stopping. He has flown for many
weary days and nights, over cold and
lifeless lands; over mountains brown and
sere; over woodlands stripped of leaves
and bare and uninviting. All day long
the “konk,” “konk” of the leader sounds
from the point of the triangle that cuts
its ceaseless way through the thin, cold
air. Night after night they rest on frozen
pond or reedy lake. But one day
the air grows sweet and balmy; they
look below them at a landscape, which,
at their altitude, looks like a mighty
lake whose waves are fields of green
wheat, broken by islands of dark green
hills. It is the Basin of Tennessee. No
wonder they come down to earth again.
If I were an angel with wings and on
my way to heaven by the same route,
methinks I’d do the same thing.</p>

<p>“But the wild goose did not always
winter here,” said Mr. Adcock, the oldest
goose hunter in my town. “I can remember
when they first began to come
in. I think they began to come in after
the country got to be more open and the
wheat fields so large that they could
alight in the midst of one and the sentinel
on guard could see the approach of
any hunter. They live to an extreme old
age. I know of one flock which winters
annually in the Bear Creek neighborhood
and has wintered there for forty-two
years. The leader of the flock is known
to be at least that old. He has a peculiar
white mark on his back and is readily
recognized each year by the hunters
in that section. They propagate very
fast in their summer homes, for when
this flock left last year it had been reduced
to eighteen in number. This year,
when it came back, led again by the old
gander, it had increased to two hundred
and eighty. But I do not think there
is a man in that country who would shoot
at that old leader with the white mark
on him.”</p>

<p>There has always been something peculiarly
fascinating to me in the flight
of a wild goose or wild duck. I have
run up on wild turkeys and seen them in
their wild and awkward flight, and while
it is beautiful sport to kill a strutting
old gobbler who comes to you, allured
by your call, and while it is finer sport
the next day to sample him when he is
baked and browned to a queen’s taste,
yet after all he is bred and raised with
us, he comes from our woods, not from
far distant shores, walks over the earth,
does not cleave, like the wild goose,

<p>And so there is a mystery about him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
that, to me, is the mystery of other lands
and worlds. There is about him the manner
as of one who comes from distant
climes; there is the everlasting wonder
which to me always hangs around the
whistle of wings, the admiration for the
creature to whom God has given the
power to soar above the sordid things of
earth and bathe their plumage in that
air which is born of the sunset and the
silent stars. And in this connection

expresses what we commoner mortals
can only feel.</p>

<p>For several weeks I had seen the wild
geese flying over us. I knew where they
were going—to the wheat fields—and I
knew where they roosted at night—under
the shadow of the bluff of the river, sitting
like swans on the dark waters. I
hold it of guns as I do of sulkies and
road carts—any good make is good
enough. It all depends on whom you
happen to start in with. If built by honest
men, out of honest stuff, there is but
little difference in the rest of it. I
happen to fancy the Ithaca and had just
got me a new one, and for hard, clean,
honest shooting, wear and tear, I’ll put
it against any of them.</p>

<p>There is only one way to hunt wild
geese successfully, and I had prepared
all of that; or rather my friend Jno. W.
Jackson, assistant postmaster, and the
best all-round hunter and fisherman in
Tennessee, had—in fact it is part of our
stable and belongs in our barn on the
rafters, along with the saddle and harness:
a strong, light canoe that will hold
three people, two big reflecting headlight
lanterns that will light up the river from
bank to bank, and for very cold weather
a good Clark or Lehman heater to drop
in the bottom of the canoe and put your
feet on if they get cold. Then, with a
laprobe over your knees, good gloves and
overcoat, and Jimmy Caldwell, who
knows every crook and turn of the river
for a hundred miles, to paddle it, you
are ready for the finest sport on this
side the globe. It was just noon when
my man, Frank, hooked up the blue roan
Chestnut Hal mare to the buckboard.
In the rear were my blankets and gun,
and oil-cloth to sleep on; also a saddle
and bridle. There is something about
a blue roan that I always have liked.
It reminds me of steel. I have never
seen a quitter that was that color. It
is remarkable how often the roan horse
figures in the living romance of our literature.
Who that has ever read it has
forgotten the strawberry roan mare of
the big-hearted robber in “Lorna Doone”—to
my mind as fine a novel as was ever
written—a kind of Shakespeare in prose
in the wild woods. Do you remember
Browning’s “How They Brought the Good
News from Ghent to Aix,” and the roan
that dropped dead but never gave up
the race? By the way, there are, in that
poem, two of as fine descriptive verses
of horses in motion as I ever read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And against him the cattle stood black every one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To stare through the mist at us galloping past</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I saw my stout galloper, Roland, at last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With resolute shoulders, each butting away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The haze, as some bluff river headland the spray.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one eye’s black intelligence—ever that glance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the thick, heavy spume-flakes, which aye and anon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His fierce lips shook upward in galloping on”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I claim that the Hals are the best all-round
horses in the world—they are tireless
roadsters and jog, at a trot, a good
road gait. By half past one I was in
Williamsport—twelve miles—and the
roan mare had not struck a pace—her
fastest gait. After crossing the river
and getting into the rough roads over
the hills of Hickman County, she climbed
them like a mountain goat, for if there
is anything a pacer likes it is to chop
up his gait for hill work. Not once did
she make a misstep. The chief beauty
of these hunts, to me, had always been in
the fact that I had only to throw a saddle
on this mare, after getting to camp,
and I had an easy seat all day in our
rides over the hills and fields in pursuit
of that most delightful of all Southern
game—quail. It knocks the sport out of
things when you have to take one horse
to drive and another to ride, and another
to do this, and another that. Reared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
for generations as one of the family,
the Hal horse can come very nearly
doing everything that his master can,
and if this mare had asked me for a
toddy before breakfast the next morning
I should not have been at all surprised.</p>

<p>My destination was the little village
of Shady Grove, way up in the foothills,
and yet down in a little valley thirty
miles from nowhere. We reached it just
before sunset, when the smoke began to
curl up out of the chimneys for the evening
meal, and I stopped on the high hill
and looked down on the quiet scene. I
have always held that it does a man
good to get away from the sound of trade
and traffic now and then, and for my
part there is nothing that appeals to
me so much as to look down on one of
these little villages in the hills and speculate
on the simple life that exists there.
So free from the knockout battles of the
modern life, so simple and quiet and
wanting so little. There is the school
house, yonder the quaint little church
which means so much to them and,
whether narrow, quaint or clannish,
we must admit are the real bulwarks
of all the great moral structures
that are the strength and pride and glory
of twentieth century progress. The little
homes cluster around these two. Once a
day the mail boy rides over the hills
on his pacing horse, with the thoughts of
the rest of the world in his leathern
pouch. In the twilight I could see that
the village blacksmith, a sturdy, handsome
young fellow, was forging a horse-shoe.
A pretty girl came out of the
little postoffice and locked the door. She
stopped at the blacksmith’s as she passed
and they laughed and made love. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
smiled as I drove on, and said: “This is
the glorious twentieth century with all
its knowledge and science and progress,
and yet when we come to think of it
we are right where we were two hundred
years ago, for in spite of engines and
automobiles the two things that progress
must have first of all, before she can
move a foot—is a horse-shoe and—love.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>My destination was three miles farther—at
Hen Island—but, when I reached it
night had set in and, to my astonishment,
I saw neither camp nor canoe. It is one
hundred miles by river to Hen Island, a
fine all-day and all-night float, with plenty
of geese and ducks. The canoe had
started down with the Old Hunter
and Mr. Jackson, the setter dog
and the camping outfit, and I expected
them to meet me with a full
game bag, and to have the camp pitched
and supper ready. Instead, I sat alone
on the banks of a river, in the chill of a
winter’s evening, out in the woods, and
with no prospect of anything but the
ground to sleep on. I had begun to feel
uneasy and dreadfully lonesome, when
I noticed a native come down to water
the mule he was riding. In answer to
my inquiry he said that the Old Hunter
had landed there that morning and had
tacked a card on the sycamore tree near
where I stood. I struck a match and
soon deciphered the old man’s peculiar
spelling, which told me he had gone on
two miles further to camp at a better
place.</p>

<p>A camp-fire at night will draw two
months’ work and worry out of a man.
How grand the trees look in the big,
weird flashes of the firelight in front of
the tent! The setter dog is at home and
welcomes you with his honest bark and
playful gambols. You can smell the
fine flavor of the boiling coffee (does
any other ever taste so good?) a quarter
of a mile before you get to it, while the
odor that comes up from the “skillet” is
enough to bring every wolf out of the
woods. In addition to all this the Old
Hunter had two barbecued squirrels and,
best of all, a mallard which he had
cooked in his own inimitable way. That
is to say, he had dressed it, all except
taking off the feathers. Then he had
pasted a wet clay all over it, wrapped it
in wet paper and buried it just under the
sod of the camp fire. In two hours it was
pronounced done, and then he had taken
it out, soon after I came up, and with a
few hefty touches had peeled the clay
and feathers off, with the skin. You may
not think this is good until you eat it at
camp; then you will not want to eat
duck any other way.</p>

<p>The night had grown intensely dark,
it seemed to me. The setter was asleep
by the camp-fire, the river sang a surly
song as it swept by in the blackness and
ever and anon the “konk” of a flock
of wild geese sounded from out the heavens
as if they still flew about, disdaining
to go to roost. In my vanity I supposed
that they had heard that I had arrived
and so concluded it was best to
spend the night in the air.</p>

<p>We did not wish to start until nearly
midnight and as we sat around the
fire the Old Hunter grew mellow and
reminiscent and this was one of the
funny stories he told me.</p>

<p>“Talk about horses breakin’ the record,
an’ all that, but do you kno’ that
in my young days I broke all the records
that ever was an’ ever will be, s’fur as
a pacin’ hoss is concerned? Whut’s Star
Pointer’s time?” he asked.</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>He grunted doubtfully. “Wal, I think
I was sixteen an’ about as hefty a lad
as ever plowed a furrer. Lemme see;
I was either sixteen or it was the year my
daddy was the proud father of his sixteenth
child, I’ve forgotten which; but
I had to work like an ox all week plowin’
in the new ground an’ gettin’ out stumps
an’ all that, an’ if there was a boy or
man in that settlement that could beat
me breakin’ in a colt or hold a hand with
me in a wrestlin’ match, I don’t remember
it jis’ now. We had one holiday an’
that was Sunday afternoons, which we
spent mostly in breakin’ in of colts. Wal,
one Sunday we struck the meanest-tempered
colt that ever come down the
pike. He flung Bill, an’ he flung Jim, an’
then he flung the old man hisse’f. They
was all older than me, of course, an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
when he flung the old man it made him
bilin’ hot an’ he sez: ‘Dam sech a colt es
that! I’ll give ennybody a dollar that
will stay on his back a minnit!’</p>

<p>“Then I up an’ sez to the old man:
‘Pap, do you mean that?’</p>

<p>“‘I do,’ sez he, most emphatically.</p>

<p>“‘Then,’ sez I, ‘that dollar is mine.’</p>

<p>“Now, in them days colts wan’t broke
till they was fo’ years old, an’ this particular
colt had been raised with the
mules in the cane bottoms. I got Bill
to hold him with a twister till I got
on, an’ they turned him loose. He give
three buckjumps, one right after the
other, but I had locked my long legs
around him, and he might as well have
tried to throw off the saddle. When he
saw he couldn’t fling me he bolted an’
took up the pike like wild. He run under
trees an’ through bushes, he jumped rock
fences, he scraped trees and jumped
ditches, an’ I let him go. He run up the
road five miles to Blivens’ mill, then he
got skeered at a goat in the road, bolted
ag’in and run back home. I calk’lated he
run jes’ ten miles back to the barn lot
he started frum, an’ when he cleared the
last fence I turned loose my grip an’
turned a summerset over his head in
ten yards of whar we started. I was
sorter dazed at first, but when I came
to the old man was standin’ over me
sorter smilin’ an’ he sed: ‘Hiram, my
son, here’s yo’ dollar; you’ve been on
just a minnit!’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was nearly midnight when the big
lamps were lighted. They were placed
on the prow of the canoe, so that their
rays crossed in the river, each lamp lighting
its opposite side. I knew that the
old hunter knew every shoal and log in
the river and that no man could guide a
boat or shoot quicker or more accurately
than John Jackson. So I had no fears
of capsizing, and when I took my Ithaca
and sat down behind the lights, I was
in such a glow of excitement that I did
not need my overcoat. And that excitement
never left me. The boat glided
out and a weird and yet fascinating scene
presented itself. We sat in midnight
darkness, but for fifty yards ahead of
us the river was bright with the glare
of the big reflectors. It penetrated the
woods on either side and I felt something
awesome in the feeling that we were
uncovering the hidden secrets of nature,
peering into the midnight heart, laying
bare her shrouded woods and dark waters
and stabbing her silence and her
solitude with a knife of light.</p>

<p>Not a word was to be spoken. Everything
went by a code of signals. If
Jackson put out his right hand, the boat
moved to the right—his left hand, to
the left. One’s heart beats fast and the
blood runs hot, for as he peers into the
midnight darkness and sees the white
light creeping over the woods and the
waters, he expects every minute to see
the graceful necks and white outspread
banners of a flock of geese fall into its
penetrating circle.</p>

<p>There was a splash in the water to
the left. It was a beaver. A swift object
moved across the prow of the canoe,
cutting the water into ripples as it hurried
to the shore. It was a muskrat. A
half mile farther I almost laughed out
at the queer antics of Br’er Coon when
the big lights caught him square in the
eyes as he sat fishing for earth worms
on the bank. He blinked, and winked,
and turned his head in a quizzical way
as if wondering what that animal with
the sun-eyes was floating down the
stream. We left him standing on the
bank winking, and blinking, and too
worthless for us to startle our game with
an unnecessary report.</p>

<p>It is the unexpected, of course, that
happens, and it came a half-mile farther
down and out the top of a dead tree
lying in the river. They arose with a
whirr and whistle of wings and clatter,
almost under our prow, that I scarcely
had time to prepare. Besides, in the
light they appeared pure white and of
great size. Instead of flying away they
flew straight at our lights, for they were
blinded, and the Old Hunter said I dodged
to keep from being hit. Anyway, I managed
to fire once as they passed over
me. Then I heard the old man’s gun roar
in my ears and two big mallards fell
almost in our boat.</p>

<p>“Did I hit anything?” I asked him.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“You shot all the tail feathers out of
the duck I killed!” he said. “Phe—w—!
listen! Throw the oil cloth over the
lights,” he whispered.</p>

<p>I did, and we sat in the middle of the
river in pitch darkness. Our shots had
flushed a big flock of geese. They made
a tremendous clatter as they arose from
the waters, not two hundred yards ahead
of us. They were flying wildly about
down the river.</p>

<p>“That’s unlucky,” said the old hunter.
“In a few minutes we would have had
them.”</p>

<p>It was an hour before we had them again—at
least twenty beautiful fellows that
flashed into our circle of light. The sight
of a flock of geese on the water at night
is the most beautiful and thrilling sight
I ever saw. In the air they are long-necked,
awkward things, but in the water
they are the personification of grace and
beauty. They ride the waves like a
swan, their necks grandly arched and
the big band of white under their tails
is raised and spread like a white banner
in the light. At sight of these not a word
was said, as the old hunter moved silently
up to them and began the process
called huddling them. It took us five
minutes to do this, and all the time I
sat with my gun on them and my heart
thumping like a racer’s in the back
stretch. At last three heads crossed in
a line. I saw Jackson’s gun in front of
me leap to his shoulder, and I fired. They
arose with konks and screams and for
half a minute every gun turned on them
in the air. Then silence and darkness,
for the suction of the discharges had
put out our lights... And then!—well,
we merely fell out of the canoe! for
just in the shadow of our lights a flock
arose with a noise and splash that set the
boat rocking on the waves.</p>

<p>“Bad luck again,” said the old hunter,
as he rowed up to and picked up the
eight beauties. “We run into the sentry.
We’d killed a dozen if we’d only waited.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, while a thrill of genuine
sportsman joy tingled me to the fingers;
“but one doesn’t want to be a hog! This
is enough for one night. Let’s go back
to camp.”</p>

<h3>A CHRISTMAS FOX HUNT IN ALABAMA.</h3>

<p class="center">By JOHN HENRY WALLACE, JR.</p>

<p>’Twas the Christmas season and the
air was soft and balmy, sweet with the
fragrance of the soft southerly winds.</p>

<p>The next day, much to our delight,
promised to dawn bright and clear. Colonel
Malcolm Gilchrist, of Courtland, and
Major Otis Hennigan, of Leighton, had
done me the honor to be my guests at
“Kittikaskia,” my home, and to bring
along their superb packs of hounds, it
being our intention to go in quest of
“Old Blaze,” a big red fox that lived
in the Jarman fields four miles to the
west. This crafty red had for several
years eluded hunters and hounds
by seeking refuge in the caves of the
Tennessee River hills, but we had
planned for the morrow a scheme to
change his course, and to put him on
his mettle to outstrip the hounds, or
else succumb in the brave attempt.</p>

<p>“Old Blaze” always ran through the
same stand on his unerring way to the
river hills, and so, in anticipation of this,
we had secured half a hundred dusky
denizens of the cotton fields to go to
his crossing, form a line, and yell after
the lusty manner of their kind, when they
heard the hounds coming. We believed
that the bedlam they would raise would
divert the fox from his beaten track,
and turn him toward a level, open country,
where the chase could be followed
with ease, seen and enjoyed.</p>

<p>It was an eager anticipation of sport
most glorious that infused our hearts
with happiness as we donned our hunting
regalia that eventful morn.</p>

<p>The South is the natural home of the
true fox hunter. The lords and ladies of
the British Isles who came to this country
settled along the Atlantic Coast. And
as westward the star of empire wended
its unrelenting way, their posterity cut
through the forest and founded here a
happy, a peaceful and a prosperous land—where
oftentimes one man’s estate
rivals in area and grandeur a modern
principality. Descended from these
grandees who brought to America the
best strains of race horses, hounds and
gamecocks, the sport-loving fraternity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
of Dixieland still retain in their pristine
purity the same strains their noble ancestors
Imported and loved.</p>

<p>The Southern fox-hunter loves his
hounds. He enjoys seeing the individuals
of his pack race together. And we
were to see tested the speed and endurance
of the prides of our respective packs—Colonel
Gilchrist’s “Fashion,” Major
Hennigan’s “Prompter,” and the writer’s
“Alice.” Three faster and gamer
hounds were never before matched in
Alabama (and the fastest and gamest
hounds on earth are here), and the coming
struggle for victory was intensified
most thrillingly by our natural love for
the hunt.</p>

<p>As we rode toward the foxes’ rendezvous,
o’er the distant hills frolicked the
resonant tones of the hunter’s horn, its
plaintive notes awakening the sleeping
echoes that set the woodland dells ringing
with the sweetest of mellow music.</p>

<p>The shafts of the new-born day quivered
high in the heavens, as the stars
one by one paled of silvery lustre as the
sun kindled the eastern forests with
flames that swept and glowed away the
dawn. The hunters were splendidly
mounted, and their horses bounded away
with a spirit that thrilled the hearts of the
riders, for oft before had they been ridden
in the chase, and each horse seemed
instinctively to know that excellent sport
was ahead. The frost sparkled on the
Bermuda, bespangling it with tiny icy
prisms, while not a cloud in the heavens
marred the perfect glory of an ideal hunting
morn.</p>

<p>The hounds were held in check until
the vicinity of the foxes’ lair had been
reached, when the hunting signals were
given to forty fearless hounds that
eagerly bounded away to search field and
fell for traces of Sir Reynard. The
course was directed up the ivy-bedecked
banks of Kittikaskia, whose clear waters
flow into those of the murkier Tennessee.
Soon the course was changed
toward the Jarman fields and “Morgan,”
the Nestor of the packs, sounded the
first tocsin of game. Singly, and in
pairs, the hounds chimed in, for they
knew that Morgan never cried a false
track, and all confidently and diligently
worked to solve the problem of a very
cold and indifferent scent. Now all the
hounds join in, the scent grows warmer,
and Prompter has given tongue. When
he cries the trail, the fox is sure to be
rousted.</p>

<p>Then, like the notes of a single instrument
swelling into the magnificent crescendo
of a grand orchestra, the hounds
jumped the fox from his mossy lair and
sped away in swift pursuit, filling the
hills and hollows with music, wild yet
thrillingly in tune. Fond of detouring
the level fields before his jaunt to the
river hills, and proud of his fleetness of
foot, the spirited red began an elaborate
journey by leaving the woods and swinging
out into the plantations, now vocal
with the anthems of the happy darkies,
whose sweet songs of contentment are
cadences to the time to which they
gather the snowy cotton.</p>

<p>We rode to the yelping pack, each steed
seeming eager to outstrip the field. With
nostrils red, steaming and distended,
eyes dilated and flashing wicked fire,
they bear their riders to the density of
the thickening cry. The world seems
vibrant with the music of the cascades
of glorious enthusiasm, and hunters are
oblivious to all save the inspiration of
the matchless moment. We are now
within easy view of the running pack,
that dashed high into the air the melting
frost which descended like a shower
of diamond sparks, while Alice—game
little hound, her wild-goose notes pealing
out far above the unbroken cry—led
the pack at a killing pace. Fashion
was at her flank, with Prompter not
a length behind, and across the valley’s
fertile expanse the race for victory
began.</p>

<p>“Go on, Fashion!” yelled Colonel Gilchrist,
tiptoeing in his stirrups, his hat
off. She heard and heeded his shout of
encouragement and gradually lessened
the lead of Alice. But Alice, long an invincible
leader, was not to be vanquished
without a desperate struggle. The main
pack was spread out like an open fan.
A blanket could have covered the thirty-seven
demons that raced together to be
the first to cry the burning scent that
crazes the brains of the hounds, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
converts them into yelping, frenzied
fiends.</p>

<p>The fox and hounds entered a strip
of woods and for the moment are lost
to view. A meadow was being crossed and
Fashion, like a dart from an Indian’s
ashen bow, flashed up to Alice, and Colonel
Gilchrist set up a yell that seemed
to split the azure dome of the sky.
Prompter had fallen back and was running
with the pack. The course of the
fox was now directed towards the river.
The chase was one hour old, and hard
pressed in open country, he would seek
refuge in the crags and cliffs that overhang
the beautiful, the picturesque, the
turbulent Mussel Shoals.</p>

<p>“Follow me and see the fox!” I shouted,
and dashed away, followed by the other
hunters to a stand where the fox was
sure to cross. We reached the place not
a moment too soon, for Sir Reynard,
with long, poetic leaps, came splitting
down the vale. His head was held defiantly
in the air, his handsome amber
brush was carried proudly high. Like a
red streak he flashed into the woods and
was lost to view in its density. The
hunters remained silent until the hounds
had passed. They were heard coming
fast behind, like a maddened musical avalanche,
with Alice leading Fashion by
several lengths. While Fashion continued
the valiant fight for supremacy, her
slender black neck, ringed with white,
elevated, her shapely head was thrown
back like the antlers of a frightened deer,
dashing from the hunter’s snare to sweet
security. All the hounds but Scott’s were
well packed.</p>

<p>Away speed the hunters! Faster fly
the hounds.</p>

<p class="noindent">At once there arose so wild a yell,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As if all the fiends from heaven that fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had pealed the banner cry of hell.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The fox was approaching the crossing
to the river. The negroes on guard had
heard the hounds coming and were endeavoring
to turn him back.</p>

<p>Old Blaze was terrified at the outcry,
and swerved to the right and sought
safety by endeavoring to show to the
pack a burst of speed that would soon
place him so far ahead as to leave behind
only a very cold trail. But the
hounds were equal to the emergency, and
turned with the fox without a momentary
bobble, and back to the Jarman fields
proceeded the electrifying march, “full
cry” being rendered by the grandest of
musicians, whose music has inspired
kings and peasants alike, infused them
with nobler ambitions and attuned their
hearts and primed their souls to the
songs caroled by angel voices. Prompter
has left the pack and now challenges
Alice and Fashion. It becomes indeed
a killing race for victory.</p>

<p>The chase is now two hours old. The
fox found that he could not outstrip the
pack. His revengeful pursuers could
not be evaded by swift running tactics,
for the air was damp and still, and he
left behind him a scorching trail. One
hope only now remained for him—he
must make for the river hills, or else
succumb. The fox on his circle back
toward the river ran two miles west of
where he had formerly tried to cross,
and ere long the chase was on the bluff
overlooking the river, whose broad expanse
was dotted here and there with
islets that seemed to float like graceful
gondolas of green, and each echoed the
notes of the hounds and, altogether,
sounded like a hundred packs running
in the river. Alice still maintained the
lead. As the hounds dashed down a
steep declivity, in sight of all, she is
seen to strike her shoulder against a
cruel projecting rock that causes her to
tumble. She quickly got up and made an
effort to follow the track, but her shoulder
refuses to respond to her will and
her foot hangs limp—her shoulder was
broken. On three legs she follows far
behind, crying the scent.</p>

<p>I hastily dismounted and caught her
in my arms, giving rein to my mount.
I was determined that she should see
the finish, she who was so unfortunately
deterred from brilliantly winning.</p>

<p>It is two miles to where the fox intends
to go to earth. Fashion is crying
the lead not sixty yards behind the
quarry. The pack, with flaming tongues,
is just behind, giving vent to short, defiant
yelps. My horse is intensely excited
and determined to outstrip the
hunting field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>Ho! hear that defiant, agonized cry!</p>

<p>It is a sight race!</p>

<p>The hounds see the fox. His requiem
is being sounded at every note. The
fox is within a few hundred yards of his
place of safety. The hounds seem to
know it, and are running with an inspiration
that means death to the fox. Little
Alice in my arms cried pitifully and
struggled tenaciously to be released,
that she might endeavor to go to the
vortex of the revengeful cry.</p>

<p>The hounds are closing in on the fox,
and the splendid red turns toward his
frantic pursuers, and rushes into the steel-hinged
jaws of Fashion, meeting death
as only the courageous die—facing it
without a murmur. Prompter is the next
hound to catch the fox, and soon his destruction
is complete. In the midst of
great delight, there is passing regret, for
we deplore the fact that a creature so
graceful, so noble, so courageous should
forfeit his life after the splendid sport he
had afforded us on that grand December
morning.</p>

<h3>Floods.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">About every year or two the question
is sprung whether or not a horse is
a natural swimmer. It appears that some
horses are and some are not, if the statements
of various persons interested be
true. An old soldier, who was a colonel
in the big fight, once told me
that in a close place he
rode his horse in the Tennessee
River, hoping to swim across.
The animal never struck a lick at swimming,
but simply waded in until it committed
suicide, and but for the timely arrival
of a friend in a canoe, the rider
would have drowned also. On the other
hand, it is an historical fact that
Weatherford, the Indian chief whom
Jackson defeated and captured in the
Creek War, and who always rode a gray
horse which was at least half thoroughbred,
when surrounded by soldiers and
crowded to a big bluff on the Alabama
River, took a running start, drove the
spurs into his horse, who jumped off a
bluff fully twenty feet high, into the river.
Horse and rider went out of sight, but
rose again and struck out, the chief still
on his back, to the distant bank. So
daring and brave was the act that Jackson’s
soldiers would not shoot at them,
but let them escape into the forest.</p>

<p>There is one horse in Tennessee that
I will make affidavit to the fact that he
is a swimmer, as well as a lightning
pacer. It is Brown Hal Jr. 2:10¼.</p>

<p>On Good Friday, 1902, the heavens
simply opened on the South. Never has
such a flood been heard of—at least since
Noah’s day. Creeks became surging rivers,
rivers vast lakes of water rushing
seaward. Mr. Robt. Hutton, one of the
owners of Brown Hal Jr. 2:10¼, writes
that that game son of the old horse was
in a large stable, in which a half dozen
mules were also confined on the creek
near the town. Mr. Hutton is a banker
and was busy in his bank. The cloudburst
came so suddenly that people indoors
did not appreciate the extent of
the downfall of rain.</p>

<p>“Is there anything in your barn, Bob,”
asked a friend as he stuck his head in
the door. “I see it is about to float
away.”</p>

<p>“I should say there is,” he said, as
he started on a run for the barn. A boat
was procured and the door finally
reached, when the gallant horse was
found swimming around for his life and
doubtless wondering why he had been
shut up to drown. Once out he left no
doubt of his ability to breast a flood.</p>

<p>But talking of the flood, I suspect I
will have to make affidavit to this, but
unless several friends in whose word I
have the greatest confidence have prevaricated,
I am willing to do so. Down
in Giles, where it seems everything happens
now and then, Col. Martin Houston,
of near Pulaski, had two lovely asses of
the Mockingbird breed. These wandered
by day in a delightful paddock in Richland
Creek, and at night sang in basso
profundo to the listening lady loves. The
floods came and Richland Creek became
a Mississippi, and before the festal asses
could consult the weather bureau at
Nashville (which, by the way, I will solemnly
swear published it the day before
that it would be “cold and fair,” the next
day), these two Romeos went floating
away on the deep, with nowhere to lay
their heads. Colonel Martin grieved
sorely, for they were worth many shekels
while the South African war was on.
After the floods subsided Colonel Martin
went out to examine things, and down
the creek, a mile or so, high up in the
top of a tall sycamore tree, hung one of
his Romeos, alive and kicking. Ropes
were got and neighbors came. The tree
was tied on four sides, then cut in two,
at the base, and gradually lowered until
the animal was released sound and all
right. Now, the above is vouched for
by many citizens, but what became of the
other ass I am unwilling to publish over
my own signature, as I have some respect
even for the reputation of a maker of
rhymes. I clip this from the Nashville
Banner of April 23:</p>

<p>Columbia, April 23.—An unusual story<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
comes from Glendale of the endurance
of a jack. Two of these animals were in
pasture on the banks of Fountain Creek,
at the time of the big flood three weeks
since, and were swept away. The body
of one of them was found, but nothing
was heard of the other one till last Friday,
when, it is said, some workmen
found him buried in a sandbar with only
his head out, still alive.</p>

<p>Spades were secured and the animal
exhumed, when, so the story goes, he ate
food offered him and lived till Saturday,
when he died as the result of over-indulgence
after the long fast.</p>

<h3>Pat Connolly and the Snakes.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Here is Conductor Pat Connolly’s experience
as he related himself.
Conductor Connolly is an Irishman and
hates snakes now worse than ever.</p>

<p>“When my train reached the creek
at Wales Station, faith I never seen sich
a flood. The track
was gone—washed
away for twenty
yards or more, and
the water over everything else. I walked
out on the track ahead of the engine to
see her sweep by—me an’ Jim Tally, the
fireman, when I felt the cross-ties I was
on turn over and I went with ’em. The
water had washed the track and embankment
up that we stood on, so sudden we
never knowed it, an’ me an’ Jim was
jus’ washed along in the flood. It was
aisy swimmin’ for we just scooted along
like a mill-race, an’ by an’ by when I
passed a big sycamore with its top just
out, I hung on an’ clambered up. Jim
followed an’ we set there on a limb,
way up in the top, with our legs in the
water. We was feelin’ pretty good an’
comfort’ble till our company came. I
felt something wrop round my leg—faith,
it was a snake. They simply hung to
every limb of that tree. They was there
by the hundreds, all kinds an’ conditions
of ’em. I went up to the top notch an’
Jim after me. I never stopped to dispute
the pint with ’em, as to who was entitled
to the lower limbs. They seemed to have
got there fust an’ I gave ’em the benefit
of the doubt, anyway. They hissed and
wiggled around an’ looked meaner than
original sin. I never seen as many
snakes in my life. Night came on, but
the moon rose up an’ we could see everything
plain. The water was rising a foot
an hour, an’ Jim an’ me put up some
silent prayer that it wouldn’t get over
that treetop. Well, sah, about ten
o’clock we seen something that made
our hair rise. It was a dead nigger
floatin’ round that tree dressed in a long,
white robe. He floated under my limb
and gazed up at me, an’ I’ll swear I
nearly fell off my perch. Then here
come another, an’ another—nigger babies,
old niggers, mammies, young niggers—dozens
of ’em; some in coffins and
some out. None of ’em didn’t wanter
go by that tree, but just floated around
an’ around an’ grinned at me an’ Jim. We
didn’t kno’ then, of course, what it was,
but we learned afterwards the high water
had washed up a nigger graveyard about
three miles above. It was midnight before
they got a boat from Pulaski and
took us down. I had lost forty pounds,
an’ Jim’s hair was as white as snow.”</p>

<h3>Indian Graves.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The above sounds fishy, but it was the
actual experience of Conductor Pat
Connolly. But a stranger thing happened
than the washing up of the negro graveyard,
and one which is greatly interesting
the Tennessee Historical Society.
At a little station a few
miles below Pulaski, in
Giles County, there is a
very rich field which old
men know has been cultivated for seventy-five
years. Nor was the water ever
known to rise over it before. Before it
was known to the ploughshare, it was
a great forest, covered with trees of
great age, many of them there when
De Soto’s Spaniards marched through in
the sixteenth century. Last month I
went down into that county to hunt squirrels,
and as we rested in the woods,
turned into bouquets by blooming dogwood
and red-buds, to eat our noon lunch
by a big, cool spring, Mr. Bob Brannon,
of Lynnville, who was in our party of
hunters, told me this incident.</p>

<p>“When the waters subsided over this
field,” said Mr. Brannon, “the current at
one place had taken off two feet or more
of soil, and there fully exposed as if
laid bare by hand, was a burial ground
of some ancient people. The tombs had
been nicely built of slabs of rocks, enclosing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
the body, of which a number were
found, some of them as perfect skeletons
as I ever saw. Infants lay side by side
with father and mother and how long
they had slept there only the Great
Father knows, for not a descendant of
this ancient race now lives on the earth,
every vestige of its cultivation has passed
away and forest trees, centuries old, have
grown over their graves, which might
have slumbered on till eternity but for
the flood. I handled the skulls and bones,
but I felt as if I was touching sacred
things, relics of civilization older than
any we know of.”</p>

<h3>The Week After that Flood.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">This started John W. Alexander, the
Lynnville druggist and horseman,
and the present owner of Brown Hal, Jr.,
He had been eating a currant pie and
stopped long enough to say: “My flood
yarn is the greatest thing that I ever heard
of. An old man—a good, honest, but poor
farmer—has been tilling
a hillside field
three miles above
Lynnville for years.
The week after that flood, while plowing
in the hillside, suddenly, without any
warning, his team and plow disappeared
in the furrow ahead of him. The man
stopped and found that he stood on the
brink of a hole that had suddenly opened
in the earth and taken his team in.
Peering down he saw his poor horses,
piled on one another fully twenty feet
below. They were groaning and calling
pitifully for him to help them, but in
a half hour their groans ceased and they
were dead. The explanation is simple:
The heavy rains had cut out a sink hole
in a few feet of the surface, which broke
under the weight of the team. We raised,
by public subscription, enough money to
buy him another team.”</p>

<p>By this time, Geo. Campbell Brown, of
Ewell Farm, had eaten the other pie.
“Do you all know old man Simpson, of
Richland Creek?” he asked innocently.
We all knew him.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, he was drowned in
that flood while trying to drive some
colts out of the bottom lands before the
water was too high. His wife told him
not to go into that swamp, but you never
heard of a man taking his wife’s advice
when it comes to horses, so he was
drowned, and went on to a better land.
He hadn’t more than arrived before he
was telling it to listening crowds what a
terrible flood they had in Tennessee and
how old Richland Creek spread all over
the state of Giles. Finally he went on
and told about Pat Connolly and the
snake, the jackass tale, and the Indian
graveyard and all that, and closed by
telling that Richland Creek was twenty
feet higher than the high-water mark of
1834, registered on the old elm at Possum
Bend School House. When he said
this he noticed an old, gray-headed man
turn up his nose disdainfully and walk
off without saying a word.</p>

<p>“‘Why, that old man seems offended,’
said Simpson—‘who is he?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, don’t you know him?’ said a
listener—‘that’s Noah!’”</p>

<p>“I think it is time for the squirrels to
begin to come out again,” I said, as I
picked up my gun and started into the
woods.</p>

<h3>A Postponed Christmas Dinner.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">December, 1863, the night before
Christmas (the time above all others
when our thoughts were of home),
found the Seventh Ohio Cavalry on outpost
duty closely observing the veteran
army of General Longstreet, then in
upper East Tennessee.</p>

<p>The Christmas dinner was by no means
ready for either the Confederate or the
Union troops in East
Tennessee, as both
armies were then
living off the country,
which had long before been denuded
of almost every edible thing suitable for
man or beast. The veteran cavalrymen
of our regiment were sharing their exceedingly
light rations with their horses,
five nubbins of corn per day for each
man and his horse being the scanty allowance
from our limited supplies.</p>

<p>Under this circumstance, it was necessary
to postpone our Christmas dinner
until February following. By this time
Longstreet had retired from East Tennessee
to rejoin General Lee’s Army preparatory
to the campaign in Virginia against
General Grant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>In February we found ourselves relieved
from duty in close proximity to
the enemy, and in order to recuperate
our men and horses took station in Tuckaleechee
Cove, at the base of the Great
Smoky Mountains, south of Knoxville,
near the North Carolina line.</p>

<p>Here there was fairly good grazing for
our horses and moderately good foraging
opportunities for the men. It was here,
and in the month of February, that we
had our Christmas dinner. Somewhere
and somehow (it was not for me to know
or to ask) our mess had secured a turkey,
maybe a wild one which had been killed
in trying to bite some of our boys, and
under the skillful hands of Private Sam
Wood, of Company I, the most expert
cook in the regiment, this turkey was
roasted over a fire of live coals, which
Sam, with the utmost care, had prepared
and arranged. The turkey was suspended
from a rigging of poles at the
proper distance from the fire and by the
dexterous hand of Sam was kept gently
turning around and around, that the
roasting process might properly proceed.
Out of the sky had dropped a mess of
sweet potatoes, along with some pickled
cabbage, much like sauerkraut, which
went to complete our Christmas dinner.
Our mess, composed of the colonel, the
surgeon and the adjutant, sat close by
to watch proceedings, and to “shoo away”
self-invited guests who had been attracted
to our camp fire by the aroma
of the roasting turkey, and incidentally
to frequently wipe our watering mouths
and ask Sam if he could not hurry matters
along a little faster, as we had our
appetites with us. It seemed to us hungry
souls that never before did it take
so long to roast a turkey.</p>

<p>As we were nearing the completion of
the repast a little rain storm passed over,
but soon the sun shone brightly, showing
the tops of the mountains tipped with
snow. We were all in a frame of mind
to enjoy this beautiful but fleeting scene,
when Sam, the cook, pointing to the
snow-capped mountains, said, “Gentlemen,
there is ice cream for dessert, help
yourselves.”</p>

<p>As I look back now through the vista
of more than forty years, never before
or since did a Christmas dinner taste so
good as that one of turkey, sweet potatoes
and sauerkraut, all topped off with
ice cream on the mountains!</p>

<h3>The Devil’s Wagon.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">It was plain from the old man’s demeanor
that he was “up against” something
unusual.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now,” I asked;
“did you lose out in the crap game, or
has Taylor sent for you?”</p>

<p>Taylor is Judge of the Criminal Court,
and, according to
Uncle Jake, when
any colored citizen
is guilty of an offence against the
peace and dignity of the State, Taylor
very promptly sends for him.</p>

<p>Uncle Jake, however, is a leading
member of Bethel church, and prides
himself on his ability to keep out of
scraps which are likely to involve him in
trouble with Taylor.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the old man would have
answered my banter good-humoredly; as
it was he only shook his head and sighed.
It was evident that he had had a very
extraordinary experience. I continued,
however, in my same tone: “Oh, you’d as
well tell me; I haven’t ever refused to
go on your bond, have I?”</p>

<p>“Has I ever axed yer ter go on my
bon’? Naw, sah, an de nex’ time yer
hear frum me I ain’t axin yer nuther,
case I ain’t aimin’ ter git inter nothin’ to
need no bon’.”</p>

<p>The old man was plainly in no joking
humor. So I said, “Well, tell me about it
anyway; you surely haven’t got into anything
you’re ashamed of, have you?”</p>

<p>“Naw, sah, I ain’t,” he answered, very
positively. “Naw, sah, I ain’t, case I’m
plum dead shore ef I’der had my sayso
erbout hit, hit never der happened. Yer
see hit ’us dis er way: De yuther night
atter I’d et my supper I saddled up my
little ole mule, Jack, and started to de
sto’. When I’d got up on de yuther side
er de creek, all ’twonst I seed er light
flare up ergin de telephone wires, en
fore I had time ter think erbout enything
tall, dar come ober de rise de awfullest
lookin’ thing I eber seed in my life.”</p>

<p>“What did it look like?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“Well, sah, de best I can tell yer, hit
looked like er great, monstros inseck,
wid eyes er flah as big as the head uv
er sugar bar’l, an’ jest er comin’ er gittin’.
I say, ‘Jack, I specks we’d better be

er doin’ his levelin bes’, but shucks!
t’wawnt narry biter use; that thing jes
crope right up on us like we’d er bin

hear it sayin’ right fas’ like hit meant it,
‘Gittin’, gittin’, gittin’, gittin’. Purty quick
Jack, he seed ’twant no use ter try ter git

whut wus drivin’. I looked er ’roun’ sorter
kurful like, en bless Gracious! hit

<p>“Wan’t no man!” I exclaimed in feigned
surprise, “what was it?”</p>

<p>“Ay Lawd, don’t ax me, case I don’t
know. He had des one big glass eye

En, sah, I didn’t take time ter say er

<h3>Jim and the Old Pacer.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">It’s a cold day, indeed, when a drummer
has not got a good yarn up his
coat-sleeve, and the narrator of this
swears to its truth in every particular.</p>

<p>We were sitting around
a good fire the other
evening when the subject
of last winter’s cold
spell came up and how much fun the
boys over the line were having on the
path; and, incidentally, how greatly the
interest in snow races among gentlemen
drivers was increasing each winter.</p>

<p>“But, say,” said the drummer, who was
selling cigars and had just passed around
some to sample, “talking about the fun
the boys had up North on the snow last
winter reminds me how a farmer and
an old pacer, up in a fashionable little
town in the State of York, where I happened
to be last month, hit the snow
enthusiasm of that class of fellows who
thought they owned the best snow horse
in the world with a blizzard that will
cool them off till the spring time comes,
gentle Annie. At least, they hadn’t got
over it when I left two weeks ago,” he
laughed. “We didn’t have any snow
until after Christmas, and when the cold
wave, with snow, did come, you bet they
were all waiting for it. Fellows with
fine sleighs bought in October and put
in the carriage house began to think they
would have to wait another year, while
the trotters and pacers were eating their
heads off, and hundreds of friendly wagers
lay in pigeon holes, waiting for the
snow. Well, when it came, it was a
dandy, and the snow path soon saw dozens
of races a day, with fine rigs and
fun galore.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a driver friend who lives near
the big town mentioned—runs a training
stable in the suburbs. You’d know him
in a minute if I’d call his name, for he
has driven many a good one to victory,
and he’s got a pacer you’d know, too,
for he has a mark below 2:12. But this
pacer is an onery-looking thing, if I ever
saw one. He wouldn’t sell on his looks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
for fifteen dollars, yet he won thirty-five
hundred dollars last year clear of expenses.
My friend bought him out of a
log-wagon—a curby-legged thing, with
log spavins and splints in swarms, but
gee whiz, how he could pace! Jim—that’s
my friend’s name—loves a little
fun about as well as anybody. He didn’t
go out on the snow path the first week
until he found out just who could go and
how fast, and then he just laid for the
whole gang with that old pacer. The
boys drove out to his stable time and
again and bantered him, guyed him, made
fun of him and all that, but he laid low
and said nothing. One evening he sent
for me and whispered:</p>

<p>“‘Want to make your winter oats tomorrow?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t care,’ I laughed, ‘if it’s a
dead sure thing. Haven’t got any money
to burn up in an experiment.’</p>

<p>“Jim laughed and handed me a hundred
in ten-dollar bills. ‘This shows my
faith; play it for me on the farmer and
the old pacer to-morrow, any way or
odds you want to, and if you don’t make
some yourself while you’re at it, why,
it’s your own fault.’ And then he took
me in the harness room and told me a
little tale that made me laugh all over.</p>

<p>“Well, to-morrow meant there was going
to be several races on the snow, and
all the fashionable end of town was to
be out. One or two fellows with pretty
good horses had beat everything and
were looking for more worlds to conquer.
Just after dinner Jim put on snow goggles,
a hayseed hat, the rustiest coat
he could borrow, clapped that curby-legged
pacer in an old sleigh that looked
like it had stood up in a mouldy carriage
house for fifty years, with harness to
match, put a few bundles of oats, farmer
like, in behind to save feed, of course,
in town, and jogged on in with a sort of
an ain’t-been-to-town-for-ten-years look
written all over the whole turnout.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t looking for the first suckers
he did up, though. He heard a jingling
of bells behind him some two miles
out, and came very near being run over
by a happy lot of young fellows with
their girls on a bob-sleigh, drawn by four
spanking horses. The fun they had over
Jim and his queer turnout was immense—for
about five minutes. They dashed
up beside him, asked him the price of
oats, and all that and finally hollered
out:</p>

<p>“‘Get out of the road, old man, or
we’ll run over you!’</p>

<p>“‘But I be goin’ to town, too,’ Jim
drawled out in the nasalest twang that
ever came out of a down-easter’s nose.
Then he shook up the old pacer just
enough to stay tantalisingly in front in
spite of everything they could do. The
bob-sleigh crowd couldn’t go in six minutes
at a trot to save their necks, so
they put the teams out in full run, but
that was just fun for the old pacer. They
never came in twenty yards of his oats
in the rear of the sleigh. After teasing
the babies enough, Jim turned at the first
good stretch, looked back, winked his
off eye, and said: ‘Yes, chillun, I be
goin’ to town, too, so good-bye to you
babies, an’ heaven bless you,’ and he
shot away and left them.</p>

<p>“You have heard of blackbirds chattering
in a tree, and then all of them suddenly
stop, haven’t you? The silence is
painful. Well, that’s the way it was in
that bob-sleigh.</p>

<p>“But Jim was after bigger game than
that, though he couldn’t resist the temptation
to have a little fun with every
nobby turnout he met.</p>

<p>“‘Cawn’t you pass that old fellah,
James,’ the male occupant of a swell
rig would call out to his coachman, after
Jim would wiggle along, half asleep, beside
the fancy turnout.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes, your ’oner,’ James would
say, and swell up in the true English
style and pull at his ’ackneys and spread
around blustering, and cast withering
glances on the innocent looking hayseed
rig. Then Jim would wake up, shake the
old pacer, and leave them like Mark
Twain’s coyote on the desert left the
ambitious dog—a gray crack in the air
and he was gone while the English
coachman cussed those “low-down Hamerican
’osses” with the best mixture of
Billingsgate and flunky at his command.</p>

<p>“But he got off the best one on two
young fellows who thought they had a
fast trotter. They came tearing down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
on Jim, intending to go by him like a
flash. But just as they came up Jim
shook up the old pacer, and he threw
up his tail for all the world like he was
frightened nearly to death, and with that
wild look that made Jim afterwards declare
he really believed the old rascal
was onto the game himself, he would
dart away, threatening to break and go
all to pieces every minute. This would
make the trotting fellows come faster,
and Jim would make it worse by looking
like he was ‘skeered’ nearly to death,
and shouting out:</p>

<p>“‘Gentlemen, hold up, please; you’ll
skeer the old hoss to death. He allers
runs away at a pace when he’s skeered.
Hold up. Hold up, for heaven’s sake!’</p>

<p>“Jim would let them chase him that
way for a mile, till their horse was blown
and would go to a break before they’d
catch on, and try to sneak away down
some side street. Then Jim would holler
out:</p>

<p>“‘Gentlemen, don’t never do that no
more—don’t never do it ergin, on your
life! This old hoss might ’er run erway
an’ ruined me! He always would run
away in a pace when he got skeered.
Learned it when he was a colt—got
skeered at a trottin’ hoss haulin’ a load
of manure through the medder lot, where
he was grazin’, an’ he can’t stan’ it
to this day!’ Then he would chuckle
out loud and throw this parting shot at
them: ‘But, say, young fellers, don’t you
wish sumpin’ would skeer that thar trotter
of yours, good, once?’</p>

<p>“But the meanest thing Jim and that
old pacer did was to break up a love
match. It was a young fellow and his
girl, and Jim says when he came up behind
them their horse was in a slow walk,
like they wanted that ride to last forever—and
they were so interested in looking
in each other’s eyes, and holding hands
under the robe, and they never knew
that it was daytime and that it was
the sun, and not a low-turned gas
jet, that was burning overhead. Jim
knew the young fellow, and the horse
he was driving, too. The horse was quite
a fancy looking trotter, just pretty
enough to catch anybody’s eye that
wanted a Sunday-go-to-meetin’ kind of
a horse. He had once taken a tincup
record of 2:26¼ by some hook and crook,
and on the road for a quarter of a mile,
he could trot a buzz-saw clip, as long
as he thought he was beating all creation,
and didn’t get another crotch in
his head—for he had clock works, with
a chimes attachment there, and no mistake.
There was plenty of room for Jim
to go around and let those young people
alone, but he saw too good a chance
for fun, and that’s what he was out for.
He wiggled up right behind the hand-holding
pair, and, pulling out a red silk
handkerchief, he blew his nose with a
terrible blast. He did it to attract their
attention and let them know that the
rest of the world ‘do move, too,’ but it
was more effectual than he had hoped.
That chimes-headed horse must have
thought it was Gabriel’s trumpet, for he
jumped ten feet when Jim gave that
blast, shook the lovers like an earthquake
and banged the girl’s best hat up
against the back of the sleigh. The
young fellow pulled his horse down and
looked back daggers at Jim, then
touched him up and lit out to leave him.
This was just what Jim wanted, and
he sailed after them in great shape. It
was an awful pretty race for about two
hundred yards, and then Jim let the old
pacer glide up nose and nose with the
trotter, who was walling his eye around
and already showing signs of quitting
with a little more collaring. When Jim
did that he heard the girl say excitedly,
‘Oh, Harry, is that horrid old horse
going to beat Sir Charles Grandeville?’</p>

<p>“‘I’m just feeling him, now,’ Harry
replied. ‘Wait a minute, darling, and
I will make him sick. There’s nothing
on this road can beat Sir Charles!’</p>

<p>“Jim chuckled and let out a link or
two, and the old pacer forged ahead.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Harry, but he is beating us—hurry
up, dear, let him show that 2:20
clip, or lock, or whatever you told me
about Just now. O-o-o-o Harry!!’</p>

<p>“This last remark was caused by Sir
Charles going into as many different
breaks as there are pieces in a jointed
snake, while Harry laid the whip on
him with something that sounded, under
his breath, like ‘Whoa! Dash blank your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
jumping-jack, white-livered hide! I’ll
teach you how to quit every time an
ox cart tries to pass you!’</p>

<p>“And as Jim sailed away he heard the
girl haughtily and freezingly saying:</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Harry Smith, I’ll thank you, sir,
to put me out at the first house you
pass! I’m glad I found you out in time.
Any man who will beat and swear at
his horse as you have done will beat and
swear at his wife, and I’ll never marry
you, sir, never!’</p>

<p>“As I said above, that was the meanest
thing Jim did that day.</p>

<p>“Well, we harvested our winter oats
two hours afterwards, when Jim entered
his pacer in the free-for-all down the
boulevard. Some few had caught on,
but I found enough that hadn’t to cover
Jim’s hundred I held and another for
myself, and when the old farmer and the
pacer beat the gang further than any
of them cared to tell about afterwards,
as I said before, it brought on a blizzard
that cooled all the racing enthusiasm in
that town up to the time I left, and many
of them hadn’t discovered then that they
had been racing green horses and two-thirty
roadsters against one of the best
known drivers in the East, up behind a
pacer who started ten times last year,
won eight first moneys and two seconds,
and took a mark close down to 2:10.”</p>

<p>“I see from the paper,” he said, as he
pulled out a local paper, “that they are
racing there on the snow path this week,
but I’ll bet my winter overcoat they have
taken the precaution to bar all hayseeds
and curby-legged pacers in the country.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">It is the unexpected in life, as has often
been said, that happens. The rejected
stone throughout the centuries
has always been the keystone in the arch
of fame, and genius and greatness always
have and always will come from
the bosom of Mother Earth. The best
legacy a boy can have is an honest
ancestry and a condition that forces
him to work. And, therefore, I am
always sorry for the young man
who “has a fine start in life.” He has
as many chances for failure as the “brilliant
young lawyer” has for mediocrity
and a bar-room clientage. Success despises
assistance and fame hates caste
and titles as the gods do salt water.
Mediocrity, like a faint hearted hound,
may always be found running up and
down the river of his purpose, fearing to
plunge and doubting the ford, while success
plunges in and crosses, or dies trying.
Two generations of idleness will
breed crime, while two generations of
shirt sleeves mean wealth. If the world
would stop working a year God would
have to destroy it with fire and brimstone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="dropcap">Poetry should be brought back to
the uses for which it was intended.
The metaphysical school that is trying
now to control it, and whose object seems
to be to make it a science instead of
a pleasure and beautiful way of expressing
our thoughts, should be
driven from our standard as they have
always been from our hearts. We must
go back to first and natural principles
again, and by demanding imagination,
simplicity, beauty and naturalness, make
poetry a vehicle of the pure and the
beautiful, and so simple that ordinary
minds can read it with pleasure and understand
what they read. The story
age of Spencer, Shakespeare and Burns
should be received and much of
Browning’s stuff flung to the dogs, where
it belongs. God has given us poetry to
be enjoyed, to be understood, to make
us wiser and better, to take to our hearts
and firesides. Its principle is all but
universal and there are few who do not,
in some shape, enjoy it. It was not
intended to be an intellectual puzzle, a
metaphysical science to be gobbled up
by a few abnormally developed protoplasms
and denied to the world of yearning
hearts. Imagine Homer reciting his
glorious stories of Agamemnon and
Ulysses, of “Ox-eyed Juno” and Penelaus,
“tamer of horses,” to the Greek
philosophers; imagine Shakespeare giving
“Romeo and Juliet” in a barn to the
learned of Europe. Of Burns lying in
the dew of the haystack watching the
morning star quiver like the soul of Highland
Mary and then writing his deathless
song for the ears of those people who
live in palaces and never saw a morning
star, nor felt the kiss of an honest love
in their lives.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="dropcap">The world is wild for prose stories.
The reason is obvious. The stories
have been shut out of poetry by the
metaphysical school, and, being unable
to get them in the language of the heart,
of the imagination, the world which must
have them is taking them in the language
of the commonplace. And thus is the true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
and the beautiful being destroyed to give
way to the double meaning and the sensational.
The so-called poetry of to-day
is not new. The only reason a lot of
metaphysical poetry has not been handed
down to us is because it did not live to get
to us. Five hundred years hence the
people who will know Burns will have
to hunt around in a sheepskin encyclopoedia
of biography to find out who
Howells and Henry James were. We
must not forget that contemporary criticism
placed Ben Jonson ahead of
Shakespeare, Pope above Milton, Scott
above Keats. And yet Pope and Scott
did a world of harm to poetry. They
helped to drive it out by disgusting people
with the sameness of its flow and
the smoothness of its rhythm. As if the
wind roars ’round the house by a foot
and a meter measure as Whitmore expressed
it, as if the mountain looms up
by a law of rising and falling, or the
waves thunder like a church organ.</p>

<p>But the grave of truth is never the
theme of fraud but for one generation—the
next one finds truth on the monument
and wrong in the grave. Let us
get back to truth; though dead, she is
a sweeter mistress than a living and
bedecked and bespangled lie. As Romeo
said over Juliet’s body, so with
poetry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art not conquered: beauty’s ensign yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is crimson on thy lips and on thy cheeks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.”</div>

<p>Trotwood loves to throw a bouquet—he
believes they are more easily gathered
in the sunshine around us and leave
a more pleasant memory than some other
things which might be cast, such, for
instance, as bricks and stones. Especially
does he love to throw them when
they are intended for a lovely woman.
And we have known her long—Miss
Minnie McIntyre, editor of the new
horse show paper, The Bit and
Spur, of Chicago, and so we know
whereof we speak when we say that in
her class she is simply an “only,” and her
monthly, The Bit and Spur, is a gem of
its kind, and an inspiration. It is beautifully
illustrated, its workmanship is the
finest, and is the best edited magazine
of its class in the whole country. If
you love the horse shows you cannot afford
to miss its monthly visits. This is
written deliberately and with charity
aforethought, and while it may have
the flavors of the village sanctum sanctorum,
yet when a woman gets into the
strenuous fight around her and with her
bright mind and pen rises to the very
top, there is always growing in Trotwood’s
garden a bouquet of sunflowers
for her.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Concerning Southern magazines, it is
the fact that none has ever been able to
live in the South. We appreciated that
fact with all its force when we launched
Trotwood’s Monthly. But we think we
have studied the situations thoroughly
enough to know the reason of this: First,
they have all been feeble imitations of
Northern magazines—a field so well and
ably filled already. Every section of our
country has its own character, its own
atmosphere, its own earmarks. People
North and West, when they buy a Southern
magazine, want the South to be in
it—its stories, traditions, its sunshine, its
fields, its very air. They want to hear
of the land which is harvesting and sowing,
while they are in the far-off snow,
waiting to see the good, glad earth again;
the land where the average farmer does
not spend all he makes in the summer
keeping himself and his stock warm in
the winter; the land that is Southern—the
great, undeveloped country of the
future. Trotwood’s Monthly is trying to
do this. In the second place, Southern
people are not great readers. There
are too many chances to get out of doors—any
time and all the time. Like the
petted children of indulgent parents, kind
Nature does so much for them—they do
little for themselves. And a child will
never leave the joyous out-doors for the
study, the schoolroom or the work shop.
In literature the great South is but a
child. But last and chiefest, no magazine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
has ever been launched in the South to
supply a practical demand, instead of
creating a supply. Sentiment is a great
thing, but like blue litmus paper, it
changes quickly if it meets an acid. And
sentiment meets an acid every little
while. Trotwood’s Monthly is supplying
practical demand, not trying to create a
supply, dependent on local sentiment. It
is weaving the Southern atmosphere
around a practical subject—a subject in
demand all over the world, as our subscription
list, which now has reached a
goodly number in every State in the
Union, in Canada, even to faraway Nova
Scotia, in South Africa, Honolulu and
Australia. Around this practical subject
for which there is a positive demand, we
will weave the Southern literature and
life, and in that way do we hope to live.
Sentiment alone will carry no magazine
beyond the first year, and the story of
the literature of every people—aye, of
every literary workman among the people—is
that the practical staff must go
with the first efforts long before he who
runs, learns how to read.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Trotwood’s Monthly is going slow, but
with the staff of the practical for support.</p>

<p>Trotwood’s Monthly wants good stories
and poems. Write them, but let them be
life, for literature, if real, is but the
true interpretation of life. Write of the
life around you, not of that in some other
State or country.</p>

<p>Mr. A. D. Shamel, physiologist in charge
of Tobacco Breeding In the Bureau of
Plant Industry, United States Department
of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.,
sends the following appreciative letter:
“I appreciate the high character of your
Monthly, and know that it will be of
great service in promoting the best interests
of the agricultural interests which
it represents. In the great agricultural
awakening taking place in the South and
the development of her great resources,
there is certainly a great field of valuable
work.” Prof. Schumel will favor us soon
with a valuable paper.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Men seem to be animals which would
not only betray other men, but their own
children, if there was no higher power
to prevent. One of the curses of the
South is child labor—another form of
slavery and race suicide. In the new era
dawning in the South, this curse has
come in with the spindle and the money
behind it has been so great that
in some Southern States, like South
Carolina and Georgia, the friends of
the child and of humanity have been
unable to pass child labor laws.
The legislators are bought by the money
of the corporations. The South is making
a strenuous effort to correct this
evil, but it is met by graft and bribery,
evasion and contempt of the law, and
the shame goes on. Take from anyone’s
life its untrammeled childhood, and what
is left? Not even the memory of a sweetness.
White child slavery in the cotton
mills of the country to-day is worse than
negro slavery ever was. After many
fruitless efforts, Alabama, which has rapidly
taken first rank among all the
Southern States, succeeded two years
ago in passing a child labor law, the
age limit being twelve years. On the
day this law went into effect, one hundred
and twenty-five children, all white,
walked out of one mill at Lannett, Ala.
The most of the children, perhaps, had
never been to school in their lives and
never would have had the opportunity.
Not only that, but half of them would
never have lived to maturity, and these,
at twenty, would look like middle-aged,
decrepit, ambitionless folks from whom
the life had been crushed. The use of
child labor not only promotes race suicide
and all manner of narrow injustice,
but encourages laziness in the parents,
as in nearly all cases the children support
the parents in idleness. The law
is now rendered almost null by the fact
that the parents do not hesitate to swear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
falsely to the age of their children in
order to put them to work in the mills.</p>

<p>What is a thought—an idea? The
most valuable asset in the brain of man.
Not common, ordinary thinking, but a
new thought—a thought which no one
else ever originated. There is such a
thought in the letter below, and I am
publishing it, taken from many other letters
to Trotwood, because of that particular
thought and not on account of the
nice things the author is kind enough to
say. I have underscored the thought
I have selected. Read it and tell me,
are you doing your work because you
must do something, or are you doing it
because it is the something you must do.
Think and find out, for on it depends
whether your life will be a success or
failure:</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Trotwood:</p>

<p>The first and second number of
the Monthly have come and, to tell
you how much we have enjoyed them,
I must use a big word and say immensely.
The farmer who will follow
their counsel will soon have to pull down
his barns and build greater, while he
will have treasures laid up where neither
moth nor rust doth corrupt; it is the only
magazine I know of giving advice about
this world and the next.</p>

<p>So old Solomon could not resist the
Influence of beauty, his namesake of old
fell at the same place.</p>

<p>I think you have established the origin
of the pacing horse. Poor fellow, he
has fought his way to fame, but like
nature’s gentleman,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He may not have ancestral fame</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His pathway to illume;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sun that flings the brightest ray</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">May rise from mist and gloom.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After all, it is the irrepressive in either
man or horse that makes him great.</p>

<p>When you see a man go to work because
he must do something, very likely
you will never hear about him or the
work; while another goes at a work because
it is something he must do, then
look for something great.</p>

<p>This will hold good in regard to the
newspaper jingle you spoke of, written
by someone anxious to see his name
in print. Burns could not help writing
about Mary, and so immortalized the
name a second time. I venture the assertion,
Trotwood’s Monthly is not written
because he must do something, but
rather because it is something he
must do.</p>

<p>And now, about the Dakota hunt. Well,
for beauty of sentiment and sublimity of
style, it surpasses anything that has
been written on the like subject hitherto.</p>

<p>I have read it over and over again
until I became spellbound by the magic
of the scene. It brought before my mind
the memory of other days when I, too,
saw something similar, only in a smaller
way, on the fields of Kansas. I feel I
have wearied you with much talking and
will ask the same forgiveness that Mr.
Stone granted you when you shot first.</p>

<p class="center">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The publisher of a disreputable sheet
in New York, which makes its living
by holding up society and dishing out
scandal about men and women, has sued
that splendid and fearless paper, Collier’s
Weekly, for libel, the occasion of the
exposure by Collier’s was a venomous
attack by the sheet aforesaid upon the
President’s daughter. Collier’s, with its
characteristic ability, laid the sheet open
to its knife, showing how it held up people
for hush money and lived in the gutters
of things bad. For all of which it
was sued for $100,000 by the aforesaid
sheet. In a recent editorial on the subject,
Norman Hapgood, the able editor
of Collier’s, says: “Men submit to blackmail
to protect their wives and sisters
from such sheets as this, for in the North
the pocketbook has replaced the pistol.”</p>

<p>The South, to people who do not know
her, has many faults. One of these is
the quickness and certainty with which
her men have always meted out tragic
justice to the brute, black or white, who
tears down the barrier between his own
vile passions, whether of malice or murder,
and a woman’s purity. Nor has any
court or any jury ever convicted the man
who used his pistol to protect the name
of his women. In such cases, the law
considers the man to be temporarily insane,
at the sudden destruction of his
home and happiness, and though it also
recognizes what is called “cooling time”
for such frenzy, an old Georgia judge
years ago expressed the sentiment of
the entire South on this subject when
he declared in such a case that “cooling
time with this court means ninety-nine
years.”</p>

<p>Many sheets of the kind mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
have tried to build their foul nest in
the South, forgetting that here the pocketbook
is not the god it is where people
live only for money. Its end is invariably
the same and the curtain drops to
the rapid fire of pistol shots, “and the
rest is silence.”</p>

<p>This has come from the old South
which taught that money was not all
of life, that a man’s word was his bond
and a woman’s good character her crown.
And words being bonds, men were careful
of them, for the man who has to redeem
his words with his pistol instead of
his pocketbook is more careful how
he uses them. We wish Collier’s a
speedy vindication. Indeed, we predict
the trial will prove something of the
same kind of a farce as that of the windy
Prof. Trigg, of the Chicago University,
who taught the classes that Rockefeller
was greater than Shakespeare, that our
hymns were all doggerel and much else
that was false. He was unwise enough
to bring suit for libel against a New York
daily which held him up to ridicule. On
trial he proved by his own testimony that
he was even more ignorant and ridiculous
than the defendant had supposed.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir: Your favor of October 19
has remained unanswered thus long on
account of my absence from the office.</p>

<p>I have read the copy of Trotwood’s
Monthly with a great deal of interest,
and wish to congratulate you on its high
character. You are certainly striking
out in a new line compared with our
present agricultural literature. None of
our farm papers have heretofore attempted
the literary excellence of Trotwood’s
Monthly, confining themselves
more particularly to the instructional
side of farming. I am much interested
in your venture and hope that it may
meet with the highest success. Our farmers
have been a little too much inclined
to look at the financial side of their business
and they need something that will
help in other directions. This you seem
to be able to give.</p>

<p>While reading your magazine I was
struck by the fact that my own work
has nearly all been directed toward the
financial side of farming, but you have
given me a new idea and one which
I hope will have its effect upon my future
work. I shall take pleasure in sending
you once in a while anything I may be
able to write which I think will be of
interest to your readers.</p>

<p>A man named Fessler, who ran an
apiary in the North, conceived the idea
of making honey the year round. In the
fall he loaded his hives upon a flatboat
and floated to the land of perpetual sun.
But the bees, finding it always summer,
ceased to lay up honey at all and Fessler
had his expense for his experience.</p>

<p>Lessons are easily drawn from a thing
like this. Since the world was made,
the experience of life is the nearer the
sun the less the work. But the real lesson
is deeper. Cannot the farmer who
works the soil year in and year out, with
no chance for a rest and no returns to
the soil see it?</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
